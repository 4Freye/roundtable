- Hi, and welcome to Close Up With The Hollywood Reporter, comedy actors. I'm your host Lacey Rose, and I'm here with Timothy Simons,
0:16
Sacha Baron Cohen, Henry Winkler, Don Cheadle, Jim Carrey and Ted Danson.
0:22
Dive right into this, okay, we're gonna start with-- - Hi, Lacey. - Hi, Jim. - Thank you for having us. - How are you?
0:27
- I'm good! - See, you already got points. - No, really, how are you? (group laughing) - You look beautiful home. - Thank you, creep.
0:35
All right, complete this sentence. I act because. - I love it so much
0:41
I don't know what else to do. - Starting with Timothy. (group laughing)
0:48
'Cause there is no ceiling to the amount of attention I need positive or negative, and this is a business
0:54
that provides that. - Pretty good. - Because I can do nothing else. - Really, nothing else? - Not really.
1:00
- You write. - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - Apart from writing. - You direct, you direct. - Okay, it's very rarely.
1:07
Apart from writing and directing. (group members laughing) - You guys? - I act because if you did what we do
1:13
anywhere other than a place where they pay you to do it they would arrest you. - (laughs) Fair.
1:19
- I act because I'm broken in a lot of pieces
1:25
and acting gives me a chance to reconfigure those pieces into 1,000 different things that are positive
1:32
for people to watch and eventually I will be ground down into a fine powder and then--
1:38
- [Don] Snorted, is that how you wanna go out? - Snorted, right. - For those of you who are watching, there is a guide you will get in the mail
1:44
for Jim's answers. - No, close. - This is acting. - Yeah. - Remarkably truthful. - Yes.
1:51
- Yeah. - Wow. - You're all broken, let's face it. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Why do you look at me? - I don't know. - Did you? - The most.
1:56
- I was looking through you actually. - What about you, Ted? - I'm with everyone else. A little bit broken and wouldn't know what else to do,
2:04
literally, I'd be a butler maybe, but other than that I have no other real talents.
2:09
- I would be a child psychologist. - I'd be a child. - And you two would have--
2:14
- That's right, I think it's begun already, actually. (crosstalk drowns out speaker) (group laughing) Beforehand everybody's going,
2:19
how much should we talk about, what should we talk about? Henry's sitting there going. - A noble fucking profession.
2:24
I love actors, I love writers, directors. I love going to work through a studio. I do think we're curing cancer
2:31
and it's an amazing thing to make people laugh so it's a great profession. - We illuminate life,
2:38
I mean, that's the reason that we do what we do is that we hold a mirror up to the rest of society.
2:45
- So I wanna talk a little bit about, you guys have had tremendous success in this industry
2:51
and the fame that comes with that. What do you guys wish you knew about navigating fame and success when you were first starting out?
2:58
- I wish that someone had told us about how much of it has to do with that,
3:05
navigating the business of it and how much you have to do to get to the point where you get to do the thing that you love to do.
3:12
How to manage your time, how to manage your relationships and your family and how to do all the things that you need to do to stay a whole person
3:20
while you're trying to continue to give all of that out when you're on a set, you know, it's a lot to do,
3:26
and I don't think, I think we just take it for granted. We look at it and go, wow, that's so exciting.
3:32
I wanna play these different people and these different characters and you're like, what's all this other stuff? And it's a lot of other stuff.
3:38
- I'm sorry man, I went blank halfway through that. Can you? - Yeah, I'll go to the next part, when I had just started, I...
3:43
(group laughing) As soon I'd said I you were like, yeah, I, I, me.
3:50
- What about for the rest of you guys? - I wish how to not worry as much,
3:56
to navigate to where I wanted to go, where I dreamt of going without eating myself alive from the inside.
4:03
- What were you worried about? - I was worried about everything, about losing it, about not getting it,
4:08
about not being good enough. - What about you guys? Sam Malone, Cheers, it's so big, it's, it's...
4:14
- Whatever the comfort level I've gotten either 'cause I'm 71 or some degree of success
4:21
or whatever it is, I like that I'm actually having fun at a table like this whereas years ago I wouldn't have.
4:26
I would have been too full of ego, full of embarrassment or full of, I'm now finally enough
4:32
to be able to sit at a table like this. - I think that's great. - To enjoy people. - [Lacey] When did that happen?
4:38
- A couple years ago, almost literally. When people started calling me Mr. Danson it was like,
4:44
oh, all right. - So what do you wish somebody had told you earlier on? - Relax and enjoy it, this is an amazing ride.
4:51
- He said that he was afraid before we went on the air that people would be watching reruns of Cheers
4:57
and then they will tune into this and be frightened. (group laughing) - What the, happened to you?
5:02
Your face, I want an age young camera. - Scared, someone scared him. - (laughs) Shock white, bam!
5:10
- But what Ted said is exactly correct that about last Tuesday you find out that just relax
5:20
and enjoy and you actually fit at the table. That's a great feeling. - Yeah.
5:26
- This side probably more than that side. - (laughs) Yeah. - What about-- - [Sacha] You are the comedy legends, so...
5:32
- [Lacey] What about you, Sacha. - Oh, you're gonna go there, huh? All right. - No, but listen. I mean, firstly, three of you I grew up on,
5:40
so it's slightly intimidating to be at a table with these guys, particularly Jim.
5:46
I was scared of becoming famous, but I managed to get away with it because I was lucky enough to have my characters
5:54
be famous in England, so for a few years no one actually knew what I looked like. So basically I was able to have the success
6:03
without any of the, can I call it hassle? - Yeah. - 'Cause I couldn't really see
6:08
the great upside other than if you were single as a guy you would generally be able to date girls
6:14
that were better looking than you should have been able to date. - That's a fair-- - Apart from that, I couldn't really see the great benefit
6:20
of being famous, but I was saying, so I got away with not being famous for many years.
6:26
I think that fame thing is a tricky thing. - Tricky. - I mean, I still struggle with it. - Absolutely. - It's a weird thing. - You still struggle with?
6:32
- It's a weird thing. - It's really on and off. - 'Cause it's not, yeah. - I'm telling you, kids, don't come to Hollywood, I'm serious. - Your camera's there, Jim. (Don laughing)
6:41
- Jim, what about for you? I mean, you had it on such a grand scale. All of a sudden you were the biggest movie star
6:47
in the world and your paychecks and all of it were public. And I imagine getting out of a car
6:54
it was being swarmed with people. - And 90% myth as well, so that's a tough thing to deal--
7:00
- What does that feel like, what does it-- - People create your life. - Yeah? - They take elements. - Right. - That are true and put it in an article
7:06
so the article looks legit and yet there's so much of the article that isn't true.
7:12
So that's something to kind of teach you that, hey, you know what, in order to go forward
7:17
I have to let go of what this creation is. And I ultimately found that even the me I created
7:24
wasn't real, so. - Interesting. - So that left me in an odd, precarious situation.
7:29
- The mask was not real. - And I've been writing and creating about that for a very long time. Many of the things I do have to do with the disappointment
7:37
of creating a winning personality in the world and then eventually for your own sanity and freedom
7:44
letting it go, you know? - Is there some-- - I mean, there's The Fonz sitting right here. - Yeah. - You can speak to that, right?
7:51
- Right, okay, don't look at me. (group laughing) - But whhat you're saying is exactly right, and it's not only what is written.
7:58
People come to you thinking you are other than you are. And you just have to remember 'cause it is so,
8:07
it's like a drug, you want to believe them. You want to believe you can walk on water.
8:12
And you have to just hold on and realize, you are not any taller, you don't know mass any better,
8:19
you are not smarter because people think you are wonderful on television or in the movies.
8:26
- I've seen some parts of the bad version of it, but you know, mostly it's somebody stopping me at the grocery store to tell me they like the thing.
8:31
I'm like, oh cool, you know? - I'm not jealous of you yet. (group laughing) You can go ahead of me.
8:38
- Yep. - Yep. - The thing that I think that I've sort of struggled with over the last couple years is like where I grew up.
8:43
I grew up in a really small town. One of the things I didn't like about that is the fact that everybody kinda knows your business,
8:49
and so when I was a kid all I wanted to do was get to a city and get to anonymity. - Ah-hah. - And then I started
8:54
doing this and at the same time that I got a job that I absolutely love that I get to be in this experience
9:00
with people that admire, part of that is sacrificing anonymity, and that's a really weird thing.
9:06
- No one understands. - It is like you can't-- - What that is, it's like walking on the Moon. You can wanna walk on the Moon all you want,
9:12
but then you get up there and there's no gravity and there's no air and-- - Yeah, no one told us about that. - You can't live there
9:17
and it's impossible-- - Who knew the Moon has no gravity? - So if you guys had anonymity for a day, what would you do? - Oh, I'd pass out basically.
9:28
I am so used to-- - (laughs) Yeah. - You know, that it'd be like. - Why isn't anybody telling me I'm great? - I went down to Amazon
9:35
once with my family-- - I'm in line at a restaurant. - Yeah. - Yeah? - And almost passed out. Mary accused me of being fake for no one recognizing me.
9:42
(group laughing) I did something smart early on during the Cheers years. - Cheadle, party of two. - I took all the fame 'cause fame is like
9:52
being a five-year-old kid surrounded by adults and all focusing on you. You can drive that five-year-old kid
9:58
to bounce off the walls, and I learned to take that, hey, Cheers, and go, "Thank you so much.
10:05
"I'd like to introduce you "to this marine biologist." - Yeah, look over here. - "That I think has a really important thing
10:11
"to say about oceans." And so voom, I would use that energy. And so I've actually really enjoyed
10:19
making use of my fame, you know? - I like that. - Just like other people might I get to use it, too, and I use it that way
10:27
and it's very effective. - What would you guys do with anonymity for a day? What's the thing, I mean. - I mean, I think I feel
10:34
like I kinda have it. - You do? - I have it when I sleep. - Yeah, yours is a little tricky.
10:40
- So Jim, what would you do? - Even my dog makes a big deal. (group laughing) - What would you do, Jim? - He's home, he's home! - If you had a day where nobody would recognize you?
10:48
- I don't think I'd be that different, honestly. I operate, I dropped the whole trying to be something
10:55
for somebody a long time ago, so I pretty much walk through the world except when I wanna be funny
11:00
or I wanna do something outrageous, you know, kinda tip the boat, you know? I don't have any trouble being myself,
11:06
and I don't have any trouble saying no when I mean no. I don't feel there is a pressing responsibility
11:15
to please everyone, I'm not unkind to people. I love people, I would much prefer saying "hello"
11:22
and "who are you" and "what are you doing today?" - Than selfies. - Than giving a selfie because selfies stop the world.
11:29
You know, they stop life. You then go like that and it's going on Instagram
11:35
to give people a false sense of relevance. I picture Steve Jobs sometimes.
11:41
Everybody's so gaga about Steve Jobs. I picture him in hell running from demons who want a selfie.
11:49
And that's something I have to kind of live with. Nothing to do with the person that comes up
11:56
because they're programmed to react to celebrity that way. They don't even think of another way to react.
12:02
- I see it completely differently. When people come up and you look them in the eye, and you look them in the eye for three seconds.
12:08
- Presence. - They believe that they are with you, and when they meet me,
12:14
and I'm really now calm enough to be present, they are very happy because of something I've done.
12:22
I've made them laugh, they sat with their grandmother, they sat with their dad, they sat with the family,
12:28
whatever it is, and that is a lovely thing. - So I'm an asshole, is that what you're trying to say?
12:34
- [Henry] So if they want to take the picture. - I'm an asshole, is that what you're? (group laughing) - No, I would not say that.
12:39
That's not I wanna say at all. I think you're very interesting.
12:44
(group laughing) - But if you say no to the selfie or like-- - I do. - Or like, I just don't wanna take are they,
12:49
'cause I've done that. - That's what I find is presence is good. - I get that, and I get like-- - No, because I always tell them why.
12:57
I say, you know what, I'd love to but I cannot take it in this restaurant because when you walk away everybody saw you do it
13:04
and I will never finish my meal. So thank you so much for asking. - [Don] I get an eye roll if I say stuff like that
13:10
- You do? - I've just gone on to, I look at whatever-- - I will go with you and I will be your front man. - Then I'll be with you.
13:15
- It was my birthday last month. - When they come up with an iPhone I say, "Oh, I have a contract with Samsung. "I would love to." (group laughing)
13:22
- I can't. - Oh I'm using that. That's good. - I like that. - Just throw it down and dance on it. - A lot of you have played these really
13:27
sort of indelible roles on iconic projects. I'm looking at you, but you, there's many of you
13:33
at this table, what are the unexpected pieces of the moving on process? - (gasps) I was on Happy Days
13:40
for 10 years. - Wow. - I committed hubris. I thought not that I was great,
13:46
but that it was such a big show and it was so international. - It was everywhere. - That I was going to go
13:52
from mountaintop to mountaintop. I was going to beat the system. I looked down and there were grass stains
13:58
on the knees of my jeans 'cause I slid right into the valley, it was very difficult to get hired
14:04
as an actor, and I had no plan B. I was seven years old, I dreamt of doing this thing.
14:12
I did it and I did it with an explosion. Now it's over and I had no idea how or what to do next.
14:21
- Was the show being so syndicated everywhere on all the time, was that a reminder for you?
14:28
- No. - Was that a feeling of like, I mean, I'm sure you felt blessed by it. - I was blessed by it. - But at the same time,
14:34
it's reminding you-- - No, they did a good job of reminding me all on their own. (group laughing)
14:40
- No, thank you so much, was a big reminder. - 'Cause it was everywhere. - I didn't need a rerun. - Everywhere, yeah. - It was ridiculous.
14:45
Sunday, Monday, Happy Days. Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days. Thursday, Friday, Happy Days. ♪ Happy days, happy days ♪
14:52
(Jim and Don vocalizing) - Okay. - Sorry. - What about for you? - I was lucky 'cause my character's job was to look at the crazy,
14:59
wonderful, extreme characters around me. I was the audience's way into the show, Sam was.
15:07
So I wasn't playing such an iconic character. That allowed me to move on.
15:12
I wasn't wacky Sam, not that you were wacky, but-- - [Henry] No, I totally get what you're saying. - But iconic and I was-- - I totally get
15:18
what you're saying - Eyes in, so it was easier, I think, for me. - Hollywood likes to sort of lock people in lanes.
15:24
They want something, a specific thing from you. Most often it's because you've given it to them before.
15:32
What are the things that you get approached for that you just say, oh, not this again.
15:37
- I'm grateful for every opportunity, but I will tell you I have turned down a bunch of offers or auditions for things that
15:44
are just bad versions of the things that I'm doing already. Like, if there is just too much of a Venn diagram overlap I do somewhat reject it out of hand.
15:50
- Sure. - Oh here's like a sort of gangly guy who's gonna say sexually inappropriate stuff in an office and he's gonna wear a suit.
15:55
Like okay, well, I'm doing that already. - And a really good version of that. - And also this version of me is not as funny, so like, I'm sure we all try to like--
16:03
- I've done several of the parts you turned down. - Yeah. (group laughing) - [Lacey] Done well, yes.
16:09
- You know, I mean there is that thing of like I do, although it does involve saying no to work
16:15
which I never, ever thought I would be in a position to do. I have tried to be cognizant of it
16:21
since the beginning of the show, do you know what I mean? - Absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I think I went through a period of getting multi-character ideas.
16:30
So there'd be films where, hey Sacha, here's your idea in which you're gonna play 10 characters. (group laughing) I get 10 characters.
16:36
- One of them is Eddie Murphy. - Yeah, exactly. Okay, this takes a long time. You know, so there was a period
16:41
where multiple character movies and I think there was no understanding that it takes time, and obviously some of 'em
16:47
are gonna work and some aren't. And then we've been offered, and at one point I think after Borat, because Borat
16:53
was the first openly anti-Semitic character, that I suddenly started getting Jewish characters
16:59
as if somehow I was the only Jew in Hollywood. So there was a lot of, you know, will you play this Jewish character or this Jewish character?
17:05
I think somehow Borat being anti-Semitic made me appear that I'd be very good at a Jewish character.
17:11
- All of a sudden you were really, really-- - I was Mr. Jewish, yes, yeah, yeah.
17:16
- You killed it man, amazing. And I love that movie so much and I love you.
17:22
- Thank you, and likewise. - I love your approach to uncomfortable people and subjects and the way you--
17:27
- Scaring the crap out of us. - You just laid bare the people who are supposed to be in control and aren't,
17:34
and I love it. - Thank you very much. That's a huge... - What would you like to play?
17:40
I mean, in your fantasy, what would you like to play? - Probably things I'd like to play
17:45
I probably wouldn't be very good at playing, but I don't know, I think something that is,
17:51
when I was at university, because obviously you're not in a box there, I would play
17:58
in the amateur dramatic stuff I would play this genre that was called tragedy comedy which is
18:03
something like Cyrano de Bergerac or even like Fiddler on the Roof. You have the character starts off as really funny,
18:11
the audience love them, and in the second a tragedy happens and then because the audience love you
18:19
and are engaged with you more because you've made them laugh they transition really quickly into getting sad and crying.
18:26
So my eyesight's not very good and I remember playing Cyrano de Bergerac and I didn't know what these white, I'd see bits of white coming up.
18:33
And I'd go, what are they? And they go, they were tissues. They were starting to cry. But it's a genre that you don't really see much anymore
18:40
which obviously existed back then which is the idea of funny people who can then,
18:46
because you've kind of got the audience by the kishkas you can then turn it around and get them crying.
18:53
So I think something like that would be-- - Can I coin a phrase? - Please. Calamedy. - I love it.
18:59
- That's what I look at it as. That's my show is calamedy. - Yeah. It's about a calamity, and it's handled with humor
19:10
and levity and pretty much that's what I do. You know, every trauma, and I could build a ladder
19:20
to the stars with the things that have happened or the things that I've had to endure,
19:26
but they've all turned into something really creative. - That's great. - You know, the worst injury
19:32
I've ever had I went to the art studio and I made a painting, you know, and I sat there and I went, I wish people could be here to see what that process is,
19:42
what happens to an artist when they get hurt, you know? They don't try to lash out most of the time.
19:49
They try to turn it into a bouquet of flowers. That's what I wanna do.
19:54
I wanna turn it into something that-- - And I think that's good, probably to some degree for all of us here that you do get to work through
20:02
your life and your emotions and through your art. It's pretty cool. - Yeah, and alchemize it.
20:08
- That's what I meant by we are a mirror because the more you are, I mean,
20:13
I finally defined cool by cool is being authentic. And the more authentic we are as the character we play
20:21
everybody, no matter man, woman, child, they all say, oh my God, I see myself
20:27
'cause we are all the same. - Yeah. - And so that really is positive that you take
20:33
all of that pain and make it into an art that people then can thrive through.
20:39
- Yeah, I think I'd say that the show that I just did, Who Is America? A guy called Donald Trump got elected and I was upset by it
20:47
and that anger and disappointment and revulsion,
20:53
I was expressing it by sort of sending friends emails, you know, sharing articles, look at this and this.
20:59
And in the end I felt, I was so angry I felt I actually have to channel that into
21:05
some characters. - Right. - Aimed at-- - Exposing. - Who could sit with some of those people, you know,
21:11
'cause I wanted to sit with those people who were his friends. - Right. - And that was actually,
21:18
you know, what you sometimes do through other artistic means I was like, it was strange 'cause I'd come out of a period
21:24
of doing a bunch of movies like, I have to go back to this old style of comedy that's difficult for me to do, but I have to do it
21:33
because I'm so upset, you know? - Yeah. - So that was my, it was a like, I actually didn't really care
21:42
how the show went down, I mean, SHOWTIME's gonna be upset about this. I said to them, okay, I go, I'm not doing any publicity
21:48
because I just had to get it out of my system, you know? - Today we're gonna teach you
21:54
how you can stop these naughty men and have them take a long nap. - That's right, and that's why you're going to need
22:01
a friend of mine, his name is Puppy Pistol. Now, Philip, will you show us how to feed Puppy Pistol.
22:10
- To feed him, take his lunchbox and push it into his tummy like this, just remember to point Puppy Pistol's mouth
22:19
right at the middle of the bad man. - I'm curious if you're sitting with the various people you've sat with, when did you know that you had struck gold?
22:29
I mean, I know in the case of Sarah Palin you felt like you didn't have it. What made you realize, okay, in this one, got it.
22:35
What were you looking for, what was success? - You feel it in the room, I mean,
22:41
the difference of doing stuff on stage and the stuff that we do is we kinda know when it's funny
22:47
'cause people aren't allowed to laugh around us otherwise they ruin the take. Now obviously, you know, there's no one else around this,
22:54
just the cameramen, but you instinctively know if it's funny and also if you've got enough.
23:00
- But is funny the goal or is exposing somebody the goal? What's the goal? - There's two of them. It has to be, for me, I love being funny
23:09
so it has to be funny and then if I can get something that interests me, then I'm very satisfied with that.
23:18
I wouldn't say happy, but you know, if a politician drops his underpants and charges--
23:27
- It's unbelievable what you are able to do and how you are able to get people to,
23:33
or maybe it's not unbelievable because these people are just waiting for an opportunity to share their truth. - Right, yeah. - On the stage.
23:40
But that the amount of truth, the amount of touching
23:45
the nerve that you're able to do that we can watch at home. I'm just cringing when I watch your show, in a great way. - Yeah, thank you, truly. - Yeah, laughing and cringing.
23:52
- And yet you've said, when you get O.J. Simpson sitting across from you and you're disappointed
23:57
that he doesn't confess to murder. - I didn't say I was disappointed.
24:02
I had an absurdly ambitious aim (group laughing) which was to get OJ to--
24:11
- A Perry Mason ending. - And then I shot that right at the end of the show and I had had achieved
24:19
some things that I was surprised by, so I never thought that a politician would get his buttocks out and charge, I never.
24:25
I was surprised by a lot of-- - The art dealer with the public hair. - Yeah. - Oh my God. - Was just too much for me. - Okay, so-- - I do like the idea that a bunch of people were like,
24:32
has anybody just asked OJ if he did it? Has anybody just asked him? - That's why I thought I'd go,
24:37
could I-- - Just get him wrecked. - Could I-- - Get him shit faced, just ask him. - Well, he can't get wrecked
24:43
because once he gets wrecked then he's violating the terms of his parole. - Oh, I see. - So, I did try to, but I still trained up with an FBI interrogator.
24:51
- Oh, wow. - Because I thought, and again this is reaching too high, but I thought, let me try it
25:00
because it was hidden camera. I though, would he, if he's ever going to admit it
25:06
it would be in a hotel room where he thinks he's gonna earn a lot of money and so I trained up
25:12
with supposedly the greatest FBI interrogator and eventually he goes, "Well who's this for?" And I go, "It's for O.J."
25:18
He goes, "That's gonna be tough, but okay." And then he sort of trained me up. I didn't manage to get him to confess to the alleged--
25:27
- He's not in your ear, there's no earwig. You went in and just did it. - Well, the FBI have a way
25:32
with people who are finding it hard to cofess to actually get them to-- - Wow, to give it up.
25:38
- To admit to stuff, so there is a sequence that I'd memorized to try and get O.J. to, but it failed.
25:48
- But that you'd gone through that much of a, 'cause it doesn't look like that. That's the only thing, it doesn't look like, wow,
25:54
he's checking off a bunch of boxes. It just looks like you're having a conversation. - Yes. - But it's clearly
25:59
a real skill because these people just vary with no,
26:05
very fastly just move into these places where you're like, I would never say, I would never-- - So what's the sequence? - Well obviously the sequence
26:14
is-- - You just say, come on. Like, come on. - Yeah, come on. A lot of questions, come on. - Seriously.
26:19
- Just you and me. - What he said, yeah. - That was basically part of the thing. Part of the thing was-- - Come on,
26:24
then you say, come on. - He said I didn't kill a guy. Come on, it might be that she just got really depressed, walked into the body bag, zipped herself up
26:31
and threw herself off the yacht, you know. And then suppose it is being blase about the murder.
26:39
- Right. - And then part of it is there's a kind of incremental series of questions
26:45
where you say, you know, how did you get away with what you did that night?
26:51
And then you go, how did you get away with what you did to them that night. And then, it's sort of an incredible art, but he never admitted.
26:59
- I'm just sorta nervous now to be sitting around the table. - I know, I know. - Yeah. - You're gonna start asking me questions. - Hey Ted and Sacha. (mimics phone slamming)
27:05
- I'm hoping you'll tear me open, man. I can't live with this anymore. (warm instrumental music)
27:15
- When were the last time you guys were sort of genuinely nervous to tell a story
27:20
or maybe it's how the story would be received. - [Don] Yes. - Yes, and. (group laughs)
27:27
- Yes, I mean, yeah, if you're really gonna be honest and truthful I think you're-- - So when was--
27:33
- Kinda putting yourself out there. - Give me an example of when that was. - [Timothy] Do you mean like real life or work-wise? - No, work-wise. - Work-wise, okay.
27:40
- I've only ever been disappointed when I wasn't authentic, when I had reached for something that was not based
27:49
in some authenticity, even if it's a wildly animated character. - What did that look like? - If it isn't based in some sort of reality
27:58
then I feel I've raped myself. - Which is painful. - Yes, it's difficult for some.
28:06
But you know, that's when I feel really uncomfortable when I'm on a track that isn't authentic.
28:12
- But it takes a while. - Yeah. - To get to that realization. - I'd never been disappointed
28:18
ever with authenticity. - Right. - And I was really frightened about it until a few years ago
28:24
when I started kinda sharing how I feel about things and my truth and there was a voice telling me
28:31
that if I actually didn't score, if I didn't hit a funny line every at least 30 seconds
28:38
they would think I was pompous and they would turn against me and say, who they fuck do you think you are?
28:45
And I've never had that reaction, ever. - I'd like to ask a question actually to you, which is that your style of performance
28:52
was completely unique, like you'd never seen somebody give, first he's absolutely roll on the floor funny
28:59
but you'd never seen anybody give as, put as much energy into-- - Yeah, physical, vocal,
29:06
all of it, yeah. - For it to be physical. I mean, it was like seeing an electricity somehow unleashed-- - Whirling Dervish.
29:13
- So I'm interested, when you were in the middle of performance did your state change?
29:20
What was the feeling when you're-- - It was a like a fugue state, really, it's like a fugue state, but you know I--
29:26
- Like a what, sorry? - Fugue state. - Like a fugue state. - Thank you, yeah. - Like you wake up afterwards. - Yeah.
29:32
- You know, and go, what happened? - That's what it looked like. - But it was, you know, Ace Ventura was a way to rip down arrogance
29:41
and that, you know, the powers that be in any case and at the same time it's pure love.
29:52
There's so much love in it, in that mocking except for the one I'm mocking necessarily,
29:58
but even them I just wanna go, you know this is bullshit, right? You know you're full of it.
30:06
But the performance is love, it's a dance for me. And I love actors who employed
30:13
every bit of their instrument, you know, I mean, you look at James Dean, this is a man who was expressing
30:20
everything with every, you know, he didn't just get emotional, he was emotion.
30:26
It was tearing him apart! You know, and it was everything was in it, and I love that kind of thing, so I always think of myself
30:33
as a kind of painting, you know? And it's an abstract painting a lot of times.
30:40
So I know the method, I know Stanislavski
30:45
and I know Meisner and I know what's good from them for me.
30:51
I use it, and at the same time I'm painting. So don't tell me the eyes can't both be
30:57
on this side of the head. - I think sort of unlike any other comic performance I think in television,
31:04
film history I've never really seen that kind of energy exuded, I mean, it's hilarious,
31:11
but I think it's completely unique. - It was so unique for me, it was so unique that when I first saw it I went,
31:16
"Oh, no, no, no, no," turned it off. And then I came back and turned it on again.
31:22
I mean, it literally took me a while to go, oh fuck, look at this. - This can't happen!
31:28
- It was so new to my eyes. - You can't do that! - It was like, it took me. - Well, I had the most wonderful experience before Ace came out.
31:37
I was in Chicago doing a live gig. My manager sat me down at a restaurant in Chicago
31:42
and they said, "We got kinda bad news. "Siskel and Ebert killed you" And don't know what's next from here.
31:51
- This was before Ace Ventura. - Three days before it came out they had the words on a page.
31:57
And I just looked and it said, the worst movie ever made. Worst actor ever made, this is the end.
32:05
This is whatever. - It was completely original. No one had seen it, so. - It was so scathing.
32:10
I've been disappointed so many times in my career I have an automatic downshift. I go, well, okay, don't know how it's gonna happen,
32:18
but I'm gonna have to break a basement window or something. And what happened to my just absolute delight
32:26
was that by the time I had done Truman Show Siskel and Ebert did an entire episode just about me
32:36
and called it Jim Carrey, Clown With Class. And I get emotional thinking about that.
32:42
It was incredible, like they just said, we were wrong. And I've never seen a critic say that.
32:48
But of them said, we were wrong. We didn't know what we were seeing. - That's validation. - And that's just a wonderful thing. - So I'd asked about
32:55
what makes you nervous, I'm curious, in your case, I mean, you took on, I guess it's the antidote
33:01
to the Me Too movement with the Not Me movement. But I am curious sort of in that,
33:07
and I believe that started on some level as your idea. Do you get nervous, do you think about
33:12
where that line is, what is that navigation? - Well, I mean, I think like sort of specifically to this show I've never worried only because the writers
33:20
involved are so good at handling those kinds of things and always making sure that the joke is on the right person.
33:27
So I never, I think having a back stop of talent like is in our writers room is incredible.
33:34
But as a performer I never really have gotten nervous about it just because ultimately the joke
33:40
is never on any of the people he is saying terrible things about. It's always on how terrible of a person he is.
33:47
- He is. - Yeah. (crowd applauding) - Go ahead, say something. - Oh, no thank you. - Yeah, no, you have to, they'd love it, you have to.
33:55
Look at how hot she is! Yeah, I get sprung. - Oh gosh, thank you all
34:00
so much, my Jonie, he just swept me off my feet. And I know that when he's elected president
34:06
he's gonna sweep all the dirt out of Washington, so (crowd cheering) we're just gonna need
34:11
to find a broom that's tall enough for him. (crowd laughing) - I just want to make it clear that she
34:17
does do all the housework. - I do. - Because it's politics and not only US politics but then world politics there is not a single thing
34:23
under the sun that we can't be cynical about. And moving forward, I think I will miss that a little bit.
34:29
- There's no side to it either. Everybody's in the frying pan. - Right. - That's terrible. - Everybody is in there.
34:36
I will miss that level of cynicism, but at the same time I am looking forward to not being so cynical
34:42
about every single thing that you come in contact. But yeah, I do think that nobody in making,
34:48
like the Not Me joke wants to have a joke on the victims. Nobody would think that was funny.
34:54
So I do think that from the beginning it was just like, oh, they found a really good way to do that. I just had a dumb, I was like in my backyard.
35:01
I was raking and I had a dumb pitch and I called up our showrunner and pitched him the very beginning of it and they built it out
35:08
into what it became. - Ballsy. - With you I've heard you say that your showrunners sort of take storylines or jokes
35:15
and they take it as far as they can possibly go, and then you sort of rein them in and you say, you can say that, I'm. - You're on camera.
35:21
You can say that joke. (group laughing) You wanna come in and do that one? I gotta walk around in the space of that.
35:27
No, I'm not doing that. - I mean, can you give us some examples of that and where your line is? - And ruin it right now? - Yeah, let's go
35:33
for that Seth and Evan. - Yeah, set your career on fire, no, they just push hard and I think they do it
35:39
because you don't really know where the line is sometimes until you've stepped over it and you go, oh, that was the line, I guess we're over here now.
35:46
But I think that the protection is always that the joke is always on the people
35:51
that are saying the line, we're not making fun of the people that are the subject of it.
35:56
It's that these people are so blind to, they have no self awareness that they are hilarious
36:04
because they're trying to process this through their prism of blindness, and that's why they are hilarious, you know.
36:09
They are the people who are the joke. Both of the writers are Jewish and they like to throw in some anti-Semitic jokes. - Oh, they're the worst.
36:16
- And I'm like, I'm not doing that. You can say that one, I'll make it the Black joke.
36:21
- Another thing that happens in your show is a tremendous amount of drugs, of cocaine
36:27
and I remember hearing Seth Rogen, one of your producers say that cocaine in the '80s
36:32
is much funnier than cocaine today. - Correct. - A, why, and B,
36:38
what are the sort of unexpected challenges of playing high, and I'm guessing there's other people
36:43
at this table who have-- - Oh, yes. - I'm so blasted right now. - You all. - I didn't mean now, I meant. - You're freaking me
36:50
the fuck out. (group laughing) Can we move on? - You look like a talking sponge.
36:56
- That's why this came up, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah. - For sure, sorry. - No, it's, yeah, I think it's funny then
37:02
because we are now, because we're here and we can see where it's headed and going, that's not gonna work out well for you.
37:10
I know you think now that this is brilliant juice, but it's not gonna work out. - It drove the industry in the '70s. - Exactly.
37:16
- And it was-- - I mean, I know people that were when I started, I'm not gonna say who in the show, but they were getting their per diem in coke.
37:23
- Yeah. - The prop truck was where you got your cocaine. - To go, of course. - What? - Absolutely. - I'm not trying
37:29
to be a square, but my God, I feel like I have 1/2 a glass of wine
37:34
and I worry about call the next morning, like I'm such a loser. - It was just the culture of it, it was just like do it. - Well, you gotta be deep
37:40
into the addiction to actually be able to handle it. - Yeah, that's true. (group laughing) - You'll get there, kids, you'll get there.
37:46
- Plenty far along. - Okay, but what about it playing on screen? - There's hope for you, yet. - Yeah, there's hope, you'll get there. - Is that fun, easy, or is that harder than?
37:55
- You know, you're kinda wired already. And the B12 doing it over and over again.
38:02
And it can kind of get you on. - That's what you take? - Approximating the high. - That's what it is? - Yeah, it's B, or coke. - Or actual coke,
38:09
one of the two. - Like Jim said, if you're already there, then your tolerance is so high that you need a little help, then you know--
38:14
- Powdered elephant tusk. - Exactly. - That line you were talking about. - That's the line. - Yeah, right. - Oh, I just stepped over and it's about that thick
38:21
and it's a rail, it's not actually a line. (laughing) - Yeah. - Jim was talking a bit about this validation of hearing
38:29
from the people who perhaps earlier in your career didn't have the same things to say about you.
38:34
I'm curious, you got on stage having won the Emmy. You pulled out of your pocket a speech
38:39
that was one that you had written decades ago. How much of that was career validation for you?
38:47
- I loved winning it. It sits on my dining room table, which is directly opposite the front door.
38:55
So when the man delivers my Lipitor he gets to see it. (group laughing)
39:03
But that's it, I never thought, oh, I deserve it. I never thought, oh, it took so long.
39:09
I thought, okay, in this moment I've won it. I'll tell you what I was not prepared for.
39:15
When you're nominated you think that is great. Everybody says, oh my gosh, just to be nominated.
39:20
- It's an honor. - Which only lasts until your tush hits the seat and then you want it.
39:28
But people treat you differently when you have won it.
39:34
- How so? - I don't know. They literally treat you different. Oh my God, and I'm talking about on the street,
39:41
in the industry, when you are an Emmy winner there is something, a patina they put on you
39:50
that I thought, this is strange. - Do you get a car? - Huh? - Do you get a car? - I didn't get a car.
39:56
- Oh. - I didn't get a car. - I had a different, I was nominated nine times in a row
40:02
before I won. - Right. - And when I won people would say,
40:09
well you have, like what, 10 of them, right? People don't know. - Right. - Yeah. - People don't, and my experience was like-- - They didn't know
40:16
you didn't win before. - Yeah, and the mantle of you were robbed was taken from me when I won.
40:23
(group laughing) And you were robbed was kind of a nice... - No, I don't know, the you were robbed thing
40:29
is a little bit tiresome. - You know, I enjoyed it. - Because you don't enter this business for awards you know?
40:35
- Tell some other boy tonight that you were robbed. - Can't use that love anymore. - I never felt robbed.
40:42
I was just happy that I won when I won. And when I turned around and I could feel the warmth
40:50
and the pressure of having almost no time to give the speech
40:56
and the only thing that I wrote 43 years ago was, kids, you can go to bed now, and of course the kids are now 35, 37, and 40, and 47.
41:04
- They're already in bed. - Yeah, they're already in. - I was there that night, I was robbed.
41:10
(group laughing) - In these characters that you are currently inhabiting
41:15
what are the pieces of yourselves, consciously or not, that you have sorta infused into them?
41:22
- The demon that I play, the eternal demon? - Yes, that one. - That seems like a one-to-one for me just having this for a few times.
41:29
- Yeah, was the performance. When people ask, "What's your process?" Nowadays I try the words on over and over
41:35
and over again and slowly if the words are really well-written words, which I've been blessed with,
41:40
the words start to inform me. It becomes a dance that comes out of doing the words enough time that you then perform it.
41:47
I get to play this character Michael, and if I do the words well then some sort of character
41:55
comes out and I'm enjoying it in the moment so I guess I'm there in the moment,
42:01
but I can't say that I... - There are pieces of you in it. - 'Cause I just found out this week that underneath my human skin suit
42:08
that I make myself more palatable to the humans, I'm a two-story fiery squid, so, you know.
42:16
- [Don] That's what I would've guessed. - What draws you to that role? What do you see? - It wasn't the role.
42:23
We signed on to Mike Schur's idea. He literally talked to us for two hours in a room. There was no script and we went, okay.
42:30
And I'm really glad I did because it's about something. It's about decency, it's about there are ripple effects,
42:38
there are consequences to your actions. And in this kind of day and age is really, it's a lovely,
42:45
it's disguised in nine-year-old fart humor and lots of visual magic, but we are talking
42:50
about something that matters. - Who are you really?
42:56
- All right, all right, fine, just give me one more second. - One. - Serious question. - Yeah.
43:01
- Should we kill them? - What? - It might work. We kill them, go back through the door, somehow grab them before they get to the bad place
43:09
and regroup from there, I could kill them right now. You know, it would be easy, their bodies are very poorly made.
43:14
They're mostly goo and juice. You just take the juice out and then they're dead. - Jim, you said if the Jeff Pickles role were presented
43:21
a few years before it ultimately was you wouldn't have been ready for it. Why not, and what made you ready when it was.
43:27
- (sighs) The struggle to maintain your innocence,
43:33
maintain that wonder and that divine spark in a world that's seemingly cruel and out of control.
43:40
Also, the grief aspect of it, the how do you keep that
43:46
together when you've been hit by a freight train? And you know, I have, and I know what that's like.
43:54
I don't believe that any actor can really do a part unless that part finds them.
44:01
You don't find parts, they find you when you're ready to do them and when you're informed
44:06
and you have those feelings. I want to do a show about death, something special.
44:12
- I don't think we want to do a show about passing on. - No, not passing on, death.
44:18
I don't want to say my son is off cloud surfing or hula-hooping with a halo.
44:23
I want to say death. - Well, it's brave of you but I don't think you're ready to talk about this. - I don't think I'm not ready like you think I'm not ready.
44:31
I think we need to heal. - Who's we? - I mean, what about you, taking on this role? What was it about this guy?
44:39
- I love him. I've only taught four or five times, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.
44:47
It is written so well that I don't know what to do. (group chuckling)
44:53
And again, everything is, we are blessed with wonderful writers because if it's not on the page
45:01
it ain't on the stage. I love the people that I work with. They are an incredible ensemble that make me better.
45:11
And I just thoroughly love going to work every day. - (knocks on door) Cousineau?
45:17
- Hey, Private Pyle, how you doing? - Oh, let's not call me that. - The story, just an idea.
45:25
There's an embellishment called the Dennehy Balloon. Actually it's a colostomy bag filled with blood
45:30
that Brian Dennehy used during Deathtrap. When he was shot, he would. (groans)
45:36
- To piggyback on what everyone has said and that you ape and act like you came up with it. (group laughing)
45:46
That, you know, it's true. You are bringing yourself to these roles. We don't completely shut off and we're not there.
45:55
We're there and you're exercising and you're accessing different parts of your personality,
46:00
different parts of your pain, different parts of your joy and trying to find where you and this character meet.
46:07
And sometimes you're reaching for things that are out there beyond you that you're trying to scaffold to
46:12
and other times you're like, that's a little too close. Can we not do that beat right now?
46:18
But if you're really honest, and I think all of us probably have a good relationship with the writers that we're working with that--
46:24
- Absolutely. - You're in a conversation. It's not like they just stick it all on the page and go,
46:29
say all of that, you know. You're always in a conversation, and when you're in that conversation
46:34
you're trying to get to the best iteration of what that thing is so you are bringing yourself to these moments, and that's when it sings.
46:43
I mean, my writers are perfectly happy for me to improv a scene and they go, "That's good, that was better, move on."
46:49
You know, best answer wins. - Mm. - I'm gonna call an ambulance.
46:55
- What kinda car you drive, kid? - Oh, 'cause I drive a Honda and you drive a Porsche? - I don't drive shit, I get driven.
47:01
- Mm-hmm. - In an Lamborghini limousine. AKA a Lambo limo, AKA a Limbo.
47:07
- So you get none of the speed of a Lamborghini and none of the comfort of the limousine? - Yeah, but it costs twice as much as both.
47:13
This guy is not a car guy, you're not a car guy. - I don't like your fucking tone. - You don't know shit about cracks. Who are you, Pfaff, who are you?
47:21
- What were the moments when it's too close and it's, I don't know? - Well, you know, it's funny.
47:27
In talking about the too closeness is not just, there's other people that it affects. So sometimes I don't talk about it
47:33
because it's very personal, but I have had more than one instance in jobs that I'm working on
47:39
where you're like, why is this storyline happening that's also happening in my life that these people didn't know anything about.
47:45
- Oh, interesting. - This is something that I'm getting to work through and getting to play
47:51
with these other great collaborators around me that's really something that I'm dealing with in my personal life.
47:56
- Yeah, there's a synchronicity. - Yeah. - In everything. - Yeah, it very often happens to me I've found in my work, and you're going,
48:02
what am I pulling toward me? You know, it's not just that things are out there for you to go get, a lot of times these things
48:08
are kind of coalescing around you and you're like, wow, did I pull that in so that I could work through this in some way, and it just feels like that a lot of time.
48:15
So I always feel like there's a lot of me in whatever-- - It what you're doing. - Whatever I'm doing. (upbeat instrumental music)
48:25
- And Sacha, I have to ask you, what are the wildest circumstances under which you secured
48:31
or perhaps didn't secure an interview for the show. In some cases you're undercover for a while
48:37
as you're trying to get it. In some cases you're trying to pass through major security.
48:42
- Yeah, to get in the room with the person is already a terrible ordeal. (group laughing)
48:48
So we managed to secure an interview with Ben Carson, but it was at a hotel in D.C.
48:55
I'd been living undercover for three weeks in D.C. because I didn't wanna have any sightings of me.
49:02
- Wow, wow. - Because if somebody asked for a picture of me. - They're like, oh, it's him. - What does that look like, then?
49:07
What does living undercover? - It means that no one can see your face for three weeks. - Peeing in jars and stuff like that. - So masks, is that masks,
49:13
wigs, is it masks, wigs or it just staying inside? - I don't want to go into what I was wearing,
49:19
but it's mainly staying inside and you're never going through, you're trying to avoid being seen. - Okay.
49:24
- Or you can't use your credit card or anything for as long as you're undercover
49:29
because the first person we interviewed when we got into D.C. was Bernie Sanders.
49:34
They were concerned, his team actually are great, are great because they immediately called up the channel
49:41
and they said, "What's going on?" But the channel didn't know that we were making the show so they actually honestly said, well, you know.
49:47
It's fine, they then said, well how do we know this isn't a terrorist group that are trying to attack politicians
49:55
and we might have a congressional hearing. So there was a game of cat and mouse. So I knew I had to kind of stay undercover.
50:01
Then with Ben Carson we managed to get an interview
50:06
and that hotel that we picked, there was a problem because there was a conference
50:12
of other politicians and there was Condoleezza Rice there and a bunch of other kinda high-end politicians
50:18
and the place was full of Secret Service. So me even getting to the room was a kind of huge problem
50:26
'cause there's Secret Service. - 'Cause you had to be Sacha with your ID. - Well no. You don't have present your ID at a hotel, but yes,
50:35
he came with his own Secret Service, so I'm in the other room saying, and there were probably about 50, 60 Secret Service there.
50:42
He comes with two Secret Service, but you know, we'd made a mistake. We'd gone to the worst hotel ever to interview him
50:49
where all these other Secret Service are around to make sure nothing happens. - Right, right. - And by the way, the Secret Service there,
50:57
it sounds like complete paranoia, but some of them disguise themselves as staff.
51:02
And I'm obviously disguised. - Wow. - Oh my God, balls. - So I'm in the other room
51:09
and I realize he's got his own Secret Service and I get on the phone to my lawyer and I go, what happens if they ask to see ID?
51:15
- Yeah? - Yeah. - Like if they go and see my ID and they find out it's me and blast it you know. - And blast it. - I said, "Listen, I've got fake ID.
51:21
"Can I present my fake ID?" And they go, "No." At the end of the phone he goes, "No, you're gonna go to jail." - Yeah, exactly. - I go, "What happens if the fake ID
51:27
"falls on the floor and the Secret Service pick it up?" - You're not actually presenting it, okay.
51:33
- Yes, and he goes, "All right, there may be a way "out of it, but you might get arrested."
51:38
So you're going into a scene knowing that you're trying to work out the percentage
51:43
of something bad happening. And then we booked another room
51:48
which was in case we got busted by the Secret Service that I would go to, so his team, I made one slip up.
51:56
This is the kind of, this is the problem of the stuff that I do which is that you make one mistake and the scene is dead.
52:04
- Right. - Mm-hmm. - So it was tragic for me because he was so high up,
52:09
but Ben Carson literally, his foot was stepping on set and the White House Press Secretary pulled the interview
52:18
'cause I was playing this Finnish unboxing character and I had these kids toys and he said,
52:24
"Why have you got all those kids toys?" I was like, "You know, we're going to do some unboxing." And he said, "Unboxing, why?"
52:30
And he suddenly realizes that a member of the cabinet is coming in to unbox and he had great instincts, this guy,
52:37
and pulled it so the Secret Service pulled Ben Carson but then the rest of the Secret Service in the building
52:44
are alerted to the fact that something's happening. And obviously they have to treat it as a serious thing.
52:50
So I then go to the second room that is booked under a different name. - Oh my God.
52:56
- But then we have a ex-Secret Service bodyguard and he's like, "They're listening in." I actually thought that the bodyguard was paranoid.
53:04
But it turned out that he was right. And then we're playing cat and mouse with the Secret Service. - They're trying to find you and you're jumping around. - Yes, they don't know
53:11
who I am because they have to treat it as a security threat. - Right, oh my God. - And then we're trying to work out how do we get--
53:17
- (mimics silenced gun shooting) Oh, it's the comedian dude. I like that guy. (group laughing) - And then also you're trying to keep it undercover
53:24
off even this, then it's, how do I get me out of, we know that Secret Service in the building
53:29
are looking for this guy. - Right. - This Finnish guy. They don't know what's happened,
53:34
but somebody's tried to do something. - So how do you get out? - To a cabinet minister. And then we're working out how to get out of the hotel.
53:40
And you know, we've got a back route. We always have escape routes, but then we find out--
53:46
- Now you're gonna get the interview. - And we find out they're at the escape route. - What are the escape route? - They're at the escape route
53:51
so we ended up going through the front door, the main entrance, and the guy with me, he said,
53:56
"If anyone comes towards you, I'm going to stop them." I go, "What does that mean?" And he goes, "I'm gonna stop 'em." I go, "Is that legal?"
54:02
He goes, "yes," and he goes, "you just have to get from here "from the elevator to that car."
54:07
And so a lot of, 80% of what I do is this getting in
54:12
and getting out. - Wow. - Of situations. - Do you get nervous. - I'm absolutely terrified. - And yet you go back for more
54:20
and more and more. - The junkie. - I don't know, yeah. I don't know what it is, it becomes addictive. I mean, we did this scene where I pitch building
54:29
a mega-mosque in this town and we knew there'd be upset, but you have the other stuff-- - Oh, they were really upset.
54:38
- They were really upset, but then you're in this situation where you say, okay, we wanna make sure
54:43
that even when they get upset we know they're probably gonna get upset because they probably hate the idea of Muslims
54:48
coming into their town, we wanna make sure that nobody's going to pull a gun. And so we had a security guard there and he said,
54:56
"Listen, you know, the great thing is "you're all right," because I had a clipboard, he goes,
55:02
"I've made you a bulletproof clipboard." And I go, "What do you mean?" - You're Wonder Woman. - Because if someone pulls a gun, you know,
55:07
someone snuck in a gun and they're gonna try and shoot you pull out, use the clipboard and just cover yourself with it.
55:13
- Yeah, just deflect the bullet. - I go, "It's this big." I go, "What do I put it over, like the heart or the head?"
55:20
- Center of mass, they usually go for center of mass. - Groin, groin. - Yeah, so I was like, he goes, "I don't know, because that's the size clipboard
55:25
"that I was told," so again, it's not really-- - An actor's choice. - An actor's choice. - So we had like a scene like that
55:31
and it got fairly aggressive at the end and somebody, he said, you know, it got nearly violent
55:39
because I accused somebody of being a Muslim. I said, "Excuse me sir, are you a Muslim?" And he'd go, "You say that again, I'm gonna come up." - Yeah, he said he was gonna kill you, yeah.
55:45
- Yeah, yeah. - That's on camera. - And then, so, you know, I think, you seem like you're a Muslim, and they got very offended,
55:52
and it became confrontational actually. - And what's going through your head? I'm gonna risk this, I got my clipboard?
55:57
- I go deep into character at that point. If it feels like it's going to get violent then you can't, the worst thing you can do is crack
56:05
and then realize that you're playing a character. You don't go, hey, oh, I just wanna mock you and expose your racism. - Right.
56:12
- Then you're really in trouble and then what I'm doing in my head, and again, I'm English,
56:19
not really fully aware of what's going on, but I'm trying to edit the scene so I'm trying to, I know the beginning setup to the joke,
56:26
the joke, the following joke, and then I need the out. - How do you get out, yeah. - And then I need the out for that. - The shot fired
56:33
is probably your out. (group laughing) - I wanna get out. - Clipboard!
56:38
It has the end on the end. - I wanna get an out before-- - That's astounding. - Before you're killed. - I have fucked up so many scenes
56:44
where the only threat was like rolling into lunch. Like, that's the only shit that was on my mind.
56:51
- My biggest problem is overhead lighting. I'm 57, man, it scares the hell out of me.
56:56
- It's interesting, in a scene like that, so we then go, okay, let's do the scene again. And we know that it's gotten the guy at the end he goes,
57:03
you know, now I know why you took your gun so fast 'cause we took their guns off them, weapons off them before they got on a bus
57:09
that took 'em to the river. Then we knew that the next group that were coming into the room, 'cause we wanted to do the scene again.
57:16
Do another take, we have to get another. They would have their cars outside the hole
57:21
and we were concerned that they would go out, get upset, get their guns, and bring them in. - Sure. - And so at that point
57:29
you've gotta act as the producer. And so I had a meeting with everyone. I just said, listen, we're now aware
57:34
of how angry people are getting. I want you to opt in to the next scene.
57:40
In other words, I'm assuming everyone's going home unless you say now, I'm gonna stay
57:47
because we're aware that we can't guarantee that we're not gonna be stuck in this hole
57:53
and everyone with their guns outside and not letting us out, you know? So we had, it was a kind of odd--
58:00
- Do people, I mean, how many stay, how many go? - In the end I forced quite a lot of people to go home.
58:05
- You did? - Yes. 'Cause everyone said, "We're staying," and I said, "No, actually you guys are going." You know, and obviously you have an escape wherever,
58:11
but at the end of the day we're in a situation where violence is being threatened. We know that most people had their own weapons
58:19
and we knew that it was a possibility that we might be on lockdown. We might have to stay in the building.
58:25
- How do you deal with people, do people have to sign off? - That I can't get into, but. - Okay. - That scares you? - C'mon, c'mon, do the FBI.
58:33
- 'Cause your faces as he's telling these stories is enough. - No, it's wonderful, but it is, comedy is dangerous.
58:41
It is dangerous. - Comedy is dangerous. - It truly is, I mean, there were many nights at The Comedy Store where I ended up on someone's table
58:47
with a broken beer bottle, you know. I mean, it got crazy, insane. - I'm sure.
58:53
- Oh, absolutely. - Yeah, I'm sure, listen, you have-- - Or drove the entire audience out because I stayed up too long when they hated me
59:00
I would go at them, it was not, okay, you don't like what I'm doing. - And you used to stay up there for hours, didn't you? - There was one
59:08
particular night, in fact, where I stayed up for two hours because the audience hated me so I just--
59:14
- Punish. - Made it an exercise in self-punishment and punishment for them. - And it's kinda finesse. - But what drives that, why?
59:20
- I just, anti-authority, you know, I'm that way. And I'd rather get hit than back down.
59:28
- Wow, I'd drop to the floor. (group laughing) - I'm with you. - So yeah, one night
59:34
I stayed up so long that chairs were flying through the air, it was like New Year's Eve.
59:40
There was swizzle sticks and whatever and glass and things like that and then I said-- - Where was this, in LA? - The Comedy Store.
59:46
It was a Saturday night in the main room. 250 people paying top dollar and whatever and it became a war. - Were you Jim Carrey yet
59:55
or was this en route? - I was en route. - Did you feel like you ultimately, did you win the war?
1:00:00
- [Sacha] If you're Jim Carrey, sit down on this chair. - Well, I don't know if I-- - Yeah. - Well, I'll tell you how the war ended. So I finally got offstage to huge applause
1:00:07
just because I mentioned that I was going to leave the stage. (group laughing) And they were just like. (growls) Like that, and I left the stage.
1:00:15
Then I crawled through the audience on hands and knees, popped up behind the piano during the host's part
1:00:22
and started banging on the keys and singing, I hate you all, you gave me cancer.
1:00:28
And it was an entire improvised song-- - And they loved that. - No, they got up. One at a time the tables got up and--
1:00:34
- Did you write it on the spot? - Yeah, it was just blaming them for the cancer cells that are being formed, and so I, you know, I did that
1:00:44
until the entire audience left, literally the entire audience except for five people
1:00:50
who stood around the piano and when I was done in a sweat
1:00:55
they said, "This is the greatest thing "we've ever seen in our lives." - But that's performance art. - Yeah, yeah. Now it turns into comedy. - And then I got in the car
1:01:01
and I cried all the way home. - You did? - Yeah. - Wow. - Because I don't wanna make people unhappy.
1:01:07
I'm here to make people happy, but I do have-- - So you lost. - A rebellious nature. So sometimes that gets out of hand.
1:01:14
- What a conundrum. - This is a bit of a left turn, but I wanna ask, why do you guys do comedy? - You have a thing in you
1:01:24
where it literally pushes you to say the joke either at a party or on the sound stage.
1:01:31
You literally have timing, you cannot teach it. You can't read about it in a book.
1:01:37
It is in you or it isn't, and that's just the truth. It is more difficult than I think than doing
1:01:45
just straight drama, and we get less respect
1:01:52
because it looks so easy. - And much less respect after today.
1:01:57
- Hush. - No, but it's like being a surfer, it's like being a surfer. You're in the water and there's a wave that's coming
1:02:03
and it's an opportunity to be funny. And if you have that instinct you're sitting there going,
1:02:08
am I gonna ride this wave? It's a bit dangerous, but am I gonna ride it? - I don't know that you make the decision.
1:02:15
The image is exactly right, here comes the wave. And I don't think, well, for me anyway,
1:02:20
I don't think sometimes I have the choice. I think that wave is coming and (mimics wind whistling)
1:02:26
I'm on that board come hell or high water, no pun intended. - Well, maybe I'm kidding myself, but I always feel like, especially if you're saying something
1:02:31
that's slightly dangerous, there's that cliffs of Acapulco moment. - Right.
1:02:36
- Where the tide has come in, you either dive or you don't. - Right. - And if you don't dive
1:02:42
it's gone forever. - Right. - But you know, most of the time you gotta go. - You gotta go. - Even if you belly flop.
1:02:49
- And I also think it's something, that to piggyback on something that Sacha said, it breaks down walls and it's immediately, it hits people,
1:02:57
and when you know when people feel like something's funny and even if they don't wanna laugh you're like, no, that one got you. - Yeah. - And once you're in there then you can turn it
1:03:04
and you can make poignant moments and you can make them feel things deeply because they're unguarded.
1:03:10
They've let down their defenses and you're in there and you can move around in there.
1:03:15
And it's easy to do-- - But you've excelled in both spheres, I mean it's... - I guess, I mean it's just, I never saw the separation
1:03:23
between it when I was coming up, which is where we all probably, you're still that kid, eight, nine, 10,
1:03:29
whatever years old that was like, oh, this is cool. I can play this character and people laugh and then people are sad.
1:03:35
It's still kind of that, although in 55 years it's still the same thing except it's more disarming
1:03:42
for me, I feel, when you come at it from a comedy standpoint because people-- - I don't know, Hotel Rwanda
1:03:47
I remember just that being-- - Unbelievable. - So impactful, you know, however much we can do in comedy,
1:03:53
I mean, that really changes your mindset about it. - Yeah, and even in that, I mean, even in that
1:03:59
at the beginning we really, he was disarming. The character was telling jokes and he was ebullient
1:04:06
and messing around and cracking jokes. You get in with him because you're like, oh, I like this person.
1:04:11
This person makes me feel comfortable, my guard is down. And once your guard is down now you can take people everywhere.
1:04:18
And that's something that comedy's easy to do. - I think comedy is like not always the end game.
1:04:24
People like Bill Maher and-- - It's about the art. - And Colbert and they're attacking this subject
1:04:29
in a comedic way, but I do believe that when it comes down to it and the wolf is at the door
1:04:35
there ain't nothing funny about that. And if you give them a joke about it, that's fine.
1:04:42
It heals in that moment, but it also is an out
1:04:48
for the audience and for the enemy. And the enemy goes, is this a joke?
1:04:53
I want people to know how serious I am about the threat that faces us, you know?
1:04:59
And if I make it a joke, I can, that's part of it, but if I make it a joke it's not as serious--
1:05:06
- Okay, well I watched Stephen Colbert and Seth at the end of the night because it
1:05:14
is like an antidote for the day. - Yes, mm-hmm. - And let me just say underneath those jokes, they are serious.
1:05:21
- Yeah, for sure. - Well, there's no joke unless you're on the nerve of the thing anyway. You know, if it's just frivolous, and that's something we talk about on the show,
1:05:26
it has to really be about something that's grounded and that's impactful or the joke has no power. - So there you go, you are completely correct.
1:05:34
When it is frivolous, you are so right, then you're missing the whole opportunity, but boy,
1:05:41
when you walk that edge. - That's right on the nerve. - Wow. - Yeah. - It is, but I think there's a time to say things straight
1:05:46
so they know what you mean. - I just feel like, I don't know that I had much of a choice in the matter. Like, I have always been somebody
1:05:53
I think from when I was a kid, was able to see the serious things, I just have only ever
1:05:59
been able to deal with them through this lens and this lens of like, oh, well I need to make myself comfortable in this by coming at it sideways.
1:06:07
And there is, I don't know if you guys did, I had a conversation with a friend of mine about this recently that sometimes when stuff comes up
1:06:14
with your family, I don't know if you're a bomb thrower, sometimes throwing bombs, sometimes they explode,
1:06:20
but it just, I don't know when it happened but just ever since I was a kid in whatever situation it was it was like, all right,
1:06:27
well, I'm just gonna put this in here and see how that goes. Like, it is fun. - Absolutely. - And I do feel like you can-- - But taking that risk
1:06:32
is great. - There is a risk there, but the reward sometimes is, like, this is an impenetrable person and you got in with that.
1:06:39
- Yeah. - Right. - That is a really amazing thing, and whether or not you can get to it a different way, certainly possible,
1:06:46
but my way into it has always been through that. - Complete this sentence. I knew I made it in Hollywood when.
1:06:53
- I wasn't dead yet. (Lacey laughs) - Interesting, when you weren't dead yet?
1:07:00
- Kinda, I mean, really people ask that question. I really feel like they say, well your career's, I'm like, well, let me look back when I'm done and go,
1:07:08
okay, I did that, I felt good about that because-- - Careers are something you look back at. - Yeah, I mean, I feel like all of us,
1:07:17
there's a bit of impostor syndrome I think that comes up for many of us and you're like, at some point they're just gonna go, yeah,
1:07:23
we've had that flavor, thank you, next guy. - I feel like everybody that I've met, like outwardly you look at them and you think,
1:07:30
oh, well that person's fine, like they're perfect. They're sailing, like they're never gonna have to hustle
1:07:36
and then you meet 'em and they still hustle. - You bet. - And they're still after it and it doesn't matter, and so that feeling of like,
1:07:41
I've made it in Hollywood, I don't know that that actually exists. - Exactly. - Okay, but you do have your sort of first dose of success and feeling like, oh, I can make career of this.
1:07:49
- But it's fleeting. - I did get to meet Steve Buscemi at a party one time, and I will fucking tell you that was amazing.
1:07:54
- That was your moment, okay. - That was some great shit right there. - I love it. - I knew that people were watching Happy Days
1:08:01
when I went from my first personal appearance. I got off the plane at 11:30 and there were 3,000 people
1:08:08
in '50s clothes and I thought it was a party. And the stewardess said, "No, I think that's for you."
1:08:14
And I went, "Oh, people are watching. - Yeah, wow. - Okay, so the rest of us have not made it, basically. - Yeah, apparently not.
1:08:21
- We just discovered. - A lot of times it's the people you meet, the people you get to hang with.
1:08:27
You know, I grew up with Dick Van Dyke, and I was a complete lunatic for Dick Van Dyke.
1:08:32
- Me, too. - And I've been able to meet Dick Van Dyke and he wants to hang out
1:08:38
and them saying that they love what you do is really meaningful. - Yeah.
1:08:43
- I just drew him a cartoon that I sent to him of RCA Television from 1969 and a black and white version
1:08:54
of the opening credits for the Dick Van Dyke Show where he trips over the ottoman.
1:08:59
- What a great show. - And I'm in front, and I did a cartoon of myself tripping over the ottoman in front of the television, and those
1:09:06
are the types of things that keep happening to me. I'm constantly being reminded, oh, I made it.
1:09:12
Oh my gosh, that's wonderful. And the first time I think In Living Color was huge,
1:09:19
was a huge thing for me and it was like they planted me, you know, my seedling in the garden
1:09:24
and I had a chance to bloom on that show. So I got a taste of it there. And that time in Chicago when Siskel and Ebert
1:09:33
hated my movie and then Friday happened and it was a giant hit, and the hotel staff
1:09:41
where I was staying put a dog bowl in my room with candies in it. - Aw.
1:09:46
- (knocks table) Did it. Never gonna be the same. - I love that. - I think it's a balancing act for me, too.
1:09:54
'Cause careers, if you celebrate your career in the moment then it feels like you're slowing down.
1:10:02
So you're always looking for what's next or what can I do better? Or one of these days, literally, I'm gonna be good.
1:10:08
You know, that kind of thinking, you know, as opposed to celebrating, but you also
1:10:13
don't wanna be a shmo and not go, thank you, thank you. - You bet. - Yeah. - [Ted] Thank you, but it is a delicate balance.
1:10:18
- You bet. - At a certain point you have to pick up the crown and wear it well. - Absolutely. - You know that
1:10:24
whatever that crown is that wherever your place of fame is is like, there's two choices.
1:10:30
You reject it, you push it away, you don't think you deserve it or you go, you know what,
1:10:35
I'm gonna wear this as well as I can. - And it's usually in the eye of the beholder. Fame is not, you know, you don't sit around going fame.
1:10:41
Someone comes up and says you're famous and you are gracious and you meet them
1:10:47
at whatever level they're talking about and that's-- - Was there a pinch me moment for you? - No, but I'm gonna have one, I swear.
1:10:54
- It's coming? - By the time I'm through acting. - It's coming. - It's coming for you. - Can I go back and celebrate
1:10:59
Dick Van Dyke for a second? - Yes. - Because I grew up with no television in the country. - I'm still doing his stuff.
1:11:05
By the way, Sonic is coming out and I've got moves in there that I can't wait for him to see.
1:11:11
- That's one. (group laughing) So the first thing, I got a black and white TV. Stanford University freshman, and it was my first TV
1:11:19
literally ever, I tapped into a teacher's cable, crawled out of the thing, turned it on
1:11:25
and it was 11 o'clock in the morning and it was a rerun of Dick Van Dyke, and that was my first and I fell madly in love
1:11:32
with Dick Van Dyke and then years later on Becker he played my father and it was just this full circle.
1:11:38
- Wow. - And thing of just awe. - Yeah. - He was my hero, my physical. - Yeah, he's the man.
1:11:44
- There was one time where Paul McCartney in like a Twitter question and answer session somebody asked him what were his two favorite shows
1:11:51
and one I think was just a UK reality show, and then he mentioned our show in this, like, those are my two favorite shows.
1:11:57
And I do think there was a moment of quiet in the room. It was interesting to know in that moment
1:12:02
that you were a part of something that a Beatle noticed. - Yeah. (group laughing) - Like, that seemed like a gigantic thing.
1:12:08
You didn't even get to take the rest of the day off, but there was a thing, like I grew up, I lived my entire life and it came to this moment
1:12:15
and a Beatle knew something that I did and that seems in itself insurmountable.
1:12:20
Like, that was a moment that was cool. - John Cleese for me. - I love that. - [Ted] When he knew Cheers and knew who we were.
1:12:27
- Oh, really. - Amazing. - What's the moment for you? - All those guys. - There were a lot of moments. I mean, connected with this table,
1:12:33
I used to do a character called Ali G. I was shooting in LA and then I met Jimmy Miller
1:12:38
who was Jim's manager and he said, "Jim loves your stuff. "He wants you to come over to his house."
1:12:45
At that time in England there was an assumption that no one would ever get to Hollywood.
1:12:51
You know, it had been 30 years since Sellers or 25 years since Python, there was just an assumption
1:12:58
that English comedy will never travel across the pond. And I remember the next night I turned up at Jim's house.
1:13:06
I was invited, I wasn't just-- (group laughing) I broke in and I-- - I took something.
1:13:12
- And he opened the door. And you know, it was the biggest movie star in the world and obviously brilliantly talented.
1:13:18
And he knew what I was doing. And my other hero was there, Gary Shandling, who unfortunately passed away.
1:13:25
I couldn't believe that I was there. And I was completely terrified 'cause I remembered Jim and Gary started making jokes.
1:13:32
And at one point he made a joke, you won't remember any of this, he did a really funny joke, he went like this.
1:13:37
And I thought, oh my God, at some point they're gonna expect me to make it-- - Get on the board, get on the board. - Get on the board. - He'd be in trouble.
1:13:45
- But that was an amazing moment for this guy grown up in a suburb of London who never thought,
1:13:52
you know, I thought I was gonna be a lawyer or something like that. I never thought I could actually get a career
1:13:57
out of being funny, you know? - Yeah. - I had two choices with you, admiration or jealousy
1:14:04
and I chose admiration. - Oh, that's very kind. - But I assume that is a navigation you make. - Yes, it is. - And those are two, yeah.
1:14:10
- When a new voice comes along and you've been the voice and you go, ooh, there's a part of you that goes, wow.
1:14:17
You know, have you lost your place or something like that. - Yeah? - Yeah, for sure. - But it wasn't that. I've always tried to make the choice of like,
1:14:24
what's this person doing? - Oh, you were very gracious that night, yeah. - That is making me feel uncomfortable and laugh my ass off.
1:14:33
And it's admiration, and that's the only way to go you know.
1:14:38
- Two things, this is I guess knowing that you're, whatever you wanna call it. - Made it.
1:14:44
- That you've made it is who you get to hang with, who you get to meet, you know, who are playing at relatively the same level
1:14:51
is really exciting. Do you remember the People Magazine who's hot and who's not? - Oh, for sure. - I never was who's hot,
1:14:58
and I was always on who's not. (group laughing) - I kept thinking-- - Not, not.
1:15:04
- Didn't I have-- - You got robbed! - Didn't I have to be hot at one point to be not hot? - (laughs) I never got to be hot,
1:15:10
I'm just not, not, not, not. - You're really blowing apart the logic of this People Magazine.
1:15:16
- Thank you guys so much. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - For being a part of this conversation. (upbeat instrumental music)
