0:08,"Hi, and welcome to Close Up With The Hollywood Reporter, comedy actors. I'm your host Lacey Rose, and I'm here with Timothy Simons,",Lacey
0:16,"Sacha Baron Cohen, Henry Winkler, Don Cheadle, Jim Carrey and Ted Danson.",Lacey
0:22,"Dive right into this, okay, we're gonna start with",Lacey
0:22,"Hi, Lacey.",Jim
0:22,"Hi, Jim.",Lacey
0:22,Thank you for having us.,Sacha
0:22,How are you?,Jim
0:27,I'm good!,Lacey
0:27,"See, you already got points.",Don
0:27,"No, really, how are you? (group laughing)",Jim
0:27,You look beautiful home.,Timothy
0:27,"Thank you, creep.",Lacey
0:35,"All right, complete this sentence. I act because.",Lacey
0:35,I love it so much,Henry
0:41,I don't know what else to do.,Henry
0:41,Starting with Timothy. (group laughing),Sacha
0:48,"Cause there is no ceiling to the amount of attention I need positive or negative, and this is a business",Timothy
0:54,that provides that.,Timothy
0:54,Pretty good.,?
0:54,Because I can do nothing else.,Sacha
0:54,"Really, nothing else?",?
0:54,Not really.,Sacha
1:00,You write.,Don
1:00,"Oh yeah, oh yeah.",Sacha
1:00,Apart from writing.,Sacha
1:00,"You direct, you direct.",Don
1:00,"Okay, it's very rarely.",Sacha
1:07,Apart from writing and directing. (group members laughing),Sacha
1:07,You guys?,Lacey
1:07,I act because if you did what we do,Don
1:13,anywhere other than a place where they pay you to do it they would arrest you.,Don
1:13,(laughs) Fair.,Lacey
1:19,I act because I'm broken in a lot of pieces,Jim
1:25,"and acting gives me a chance to reconfigure those pieces into 1,000 different things that are positive",Jim
1:32,for people to watch and eventually I will be ground down into a fine powder and then,Jim
1:38,"[Don] Snorted, is that how you wanna go out?",Don
1:38,"Snorted, right.",Jim
1:38,"For those of you who are watching, there is a guide you will get in the mail",Henry
1:44,for Jim's answers.,Henry
1:44,"No, close.",?
1:44,This is acting.,?
1:44,Yeah.,?
1:44,Remarkably truthful.,Ted
1:44,Yes.,?
1:51,Yeah.,?
1:51,Wow.,?
1:51,"You're all broken, let's face it.",Jim
1:51,Yeah.,Timothy
1:51,"Yeah, yeah. Why do you look at me?",Sacha
1:51,I don't know.,Jim
1:51,Did you?,?
1:51,The most.,Sacha
1:56,I was looking through you actually.,Jim
1:56,"What about you, Ted?",Lacey
1:56,"I'm with everyone else. A little bit broken and wouldn't know what else to do,",Ted
2:04,"literally, I'd be a butler maybe, but other than that I have no other real talents.",Ted
2:09,I would be a child psychologist.,Henry
2:09,I'd be a child.,Jim
2:09,And you two would have,Don
2:14,"That's right, I think it's begun already, actually. (crosstalk drowns out speaker) (group laughing) Beforehand everybody's going,",Jim
2:19,"how much should we talk about, what should we talk about? Henry's sitting there going.",Jim
2:19,A noble fucking profession.,Ted
2:24,"I love actors, I love writers, directors. I love going to work through a studio. I do think we're curing cancer",Ted
2:31,and it's an amazing thing to make people laugh so it's a great profession.,Ted
2:31,"We illuminate life,",Henry
2:38,"I mean, that's the reason that we do what we do is that we hold a mirror up to the rest of society.",Henry
2:45,"So I wanna talk a little bit about, you guys have had tremendous success in this industry",Lacey
2:51,and the fame that comes with that. What do you guys wish you knew about navigating fame and success when you were first starting out?,Lacey
2:58,"I wish that someone had told us about how much of it has to do with that,",Don
3:05,navigating the business of it and how much you have to do to get to the point where you get to do the thing that you love to do.,Don
3:12,"How to manage your time, how to manage your relationships and your family and how to do all the things that you need to do to stay a whole person",Don
3:20,"while you're trying to continue to give all of that out when you're on a set, you know, it's a lot to do,",Don
3:26,"and I don't think, I think we just take it for granted. We look at it and go, wow, that's so exciting.",Don
3:32,"I wanna play these different people and these different characters and you're like, what's all this other stuff? And it's a lot of other stuff.",Don
3:38,"I'm sorry man, I went blank halfway through that. Can you?",Jim
3:38,"Yeah, I'll go to the next part, when I had just started, I...",Don
3:43,"(group laughing) As soon I'd said I you were like, yeah, I, I, me.",Don
3:50,What about for the rest of you guys?,Lacey
3:50,"I wish how to not worry as much,",Henry
3:56,"to navigate to where I wanted to go, where I dreamt of going without eating myself alive from the inside.",Henry
4:03,What were you worried about?,Lacey
4:03,"I was worried about everything, about losing it, about not getting it,",Henry
4:08,about not being good enough.,Henry
4:08,"What about you guys? Sam Malone, Cheers, it's so big, it's, it's...",Lacey
4:14,Whatever the comfort level I've gotten either 'cause I'm 71 or some degree of success,Ted
4:21,"or whatever it is, I like that I'm actually having fun at a table like this whereas years ago I wouldn't have.",Ted
4:26,"I would have been too full of ego, full of embarrassment or full of, I'm now finally enough",Ted
4:32,to be able to sit at a table like this.,Ted
4:32,I think that's great.,Henry
4:32,To enjoy people.,Ted
4:32,[Lacey] When did that happen?,Lacey
4:38,"A couple years ago, almost literally. When people started calling me Mr. Danson it was like,",Ted
4:44,"oh, all right.",?
4:44,So what do you wish somebody had told you earlier on?,Lacey
4:44,"Relax and enjoy it, this is an amazing ride.",Ted
4:51,He said that he was afraid before we went on the air that people would be watching reruns of Cheers,Jim
4:57,and then they will tune into this and be frightened. (group laughing),Jim
4:57,"What the, happened to you?",Ted
5:02,"Your face, I want an age young camera.",Ted
5:02,"Scared, someone scared him.",Jim
5:02,"(laughs) Shock white, bam!",Don
5:10,But what Ted said is exactly correct that about last Tuesday you find out that just relax,Henry
5:20,and enjoy and you actually fit at the table. That's a great feeling.,Henry
5:20,Yeah.,Lacey
5:26,This side probably more than that side.,Ted
5:26,(laughs) Yeah.,?
5:26,What about,?
5:26,"[Sacha] You are the comedy legends, so...",Sacha
5:32,"[Lacey] What about you, Sacha.",Lacey
5:32,"Oh, you're gonna go there, huh? All right.",Ted
5:32,"No, but listen. I mean, firstly, three of you I grew up on,",Sacha
5:40,"so it's slightly intimidating to be at a table with these guys, particularly Jim.",Sacha
5:46,"I was scared of becoming famous, but I managed to get away with it because I was lucky enough to have my characters",Sacha
5:54,"be famous in England, so for a few years no one actually knew what I looked like. So basically I was able to have the success",Sacha
6:03,"without any of the, can I call it hassle?",Sacha
6:03,Yeah.,Lacey
6:03,Cause I couldn't really see,Sacha
6:08,the great upside other than if you were single as a guy you would generally be able to date girls,Sacha
6:14,that were better looking than you should have been able to date.,Sacha
6:14,That's a fair,Lacey
6:14,"Apart from that, I couldn't really see the great benefit",Sacha
6:20,"of being famous, but I was saying, so I got away with not being famous for many years.",Sacha
6:26,I think that fame thing is a tricky thing.,Sacha
6:26,Tricky.,?
6:26,"I mean, I still struggle with it.",Sacha
6:26,Absolutely.,?
6:26,It's a weird thing.,?
6:26,You still struggle with?,?
6:32,It's a weird thing.,?
6:32,It's really on and off.,?
6:32,"Cause it's not, yeah.",?
6:32,"I'm telling you, kids, don't come to Hollywood, I'm serious.",Jim
6:32,"Your camera's there, Jim. (Don laughing)",Don
6:41,"Jim, what about for you? I mean, you had it on such a grand scale. All of a sudden you were the biggest movie star",Lacey
6:47,in the world and your paychecks and all of it were public. And I imagine getting out of a car,Lacey
6:54,it was being swarmed with people.,Lacey
6:54,"And 90% myth as well, so that's a tough thing to deal",Jim
7:00,"What does that feel like, what does it",Lacey
7:00,People create your life.,Jim
7:00,Yeah?,Lacey
7:00,They take elements.,Jim
7:00,Right.,Henry
7:00,That are true and put it in an article,Jim
7:06,so the article looks legit and yet there's so much of the article that isn't true.,Jim
7:12,"So that's something to kind of teach you that, hey, you know what, in order to go forward",Jim
7:17,I have to let go of what this creation is. And I ultimately found that even the me I created,Jim
7:24,"wasn't real, so.",Jim
7:24,Interesting.,?
7:24,"So that left me in an odd, precarious situation.",Jim
7:29,The mask was not real.,Sacha
7:29,And I've been writing and creating about that for a very long time. Many of the things I do have to do with the disappointment,Jim
7:37,of creating a winning personality in the world and then eventually for your own sanity and freedom,Jim
7:44,"letting it go, you know?",Jim
7:44,Is there some,Lacey
7:44,"I mean, there's The Fonz sitting right here.",Jim
7:44,Yeah.,?
7:44,"You can speak to that, right?",?
7:51,"Right, okay, don't look at me. (group laughing)",Henry
7:51,"But what you're saying is exactly right, and it's not only what is written.",Henry
7:58,"People come to you thinking you are other than you are. And you just have to remember 'cause it is so,",Henry
8:07,"it's like a drug, you want to believe them. You want to believe you can walk on water.",Henry
8:12,"And you have to just hold on and realize, you are not any taller, you don't know mass any better,",Henry
8:19,you are not smarter because people think you are wonderful on television or in the movies.,Henry
8:26,"I've seen some parts of the bad version of it, but you know, mostly it's somebody stopping me at the grocery store to tell me they like the thing.",Timothy
8:31,"I'm like, oh cool, you know?",Timothy
8:31,I'm not jealous of you yet. (group laughing) You can go ahead of me.,Jim
8:38,Yep.,Timothy
8:38,Yep.,Lacey
8:38,The thing that I think that I've sort of struggled with over the last couple years is like where I grew up.,Timothy
8:43,"I grew up in a really small town. One of the things I didn't like about that is the fact that everybody kinda knows your business,",Timothy
8:49,and so when I was a kid all I wanted to do was get to a city and get to anonymity.,Timothy
8:49,Ah,Lacey
8:49,hah.,Lacey
8:49,And then I started,Timothy
8:54,doing this and at the same time that I got a job that I absolutely love that I get to be in this experience,Timothy
9:00,"with people that admire, part of that is sacrificing anonymity, and that's a really weird thing.",Timothy
9:06,No one understands.,Jim
9:06,It is like you can't,Timothy
9:06,"What that is, it's like walking on the Moon. You can wanna walk on the Moon all you want,",Jim
9:12,but then you get up there and there's no gravity and there's no air and,Jim
9:12,"Yeah, no one told us about that.",Sacha
9:12,You can't live there,Jim
9:17,and it's impossible,Jim
9:17,Who knew the Moon has no gravity?,Sacha
9:17,"So if you guys had anonymity for a day, what would you do?",Lacey
9:17,"Oh, I'd pass out basically.",Ted
9:28,I am so used to,Ted
9:28,(laughs) Yeah.,?
9:28,"You know, that it'd be like.",Ted
9:28,Why isn't anybody telling me I'm great?,Timothy
9:28,I went down to Amazon,Ted
9:35,once with my family,Ted
9:35,I'm in line at a restaurant.,Don
9:35,Yeah.,?
9:35,Yeah?,?
9:35,And almost passed out. Mary accused me of being fake for no one recognizing me.,Ted
9:42,(group laughing) I did something smart early on during the Cheers years.,Ted
9:42,"Cheadle, party of two.",Jim
9:42,I took all the fame 'cause fame is like,Ted
9:52,being a five,Ted
9:52,year,Ted
9:52,old kid surrounded by adults and all focusing on you. You can drive that five,Ted
9:52,year,Ted
9:52,old kid,Ted
9:58,"to bounce off the walls, and I learned to take that, hey, Cheers, and go, ""Thank you so much.",Ted
10:05,"""I'd like to introduce you ""to this marine biologist.""",Ted
10:05,"Yeah, look over here.",Don
10:05,"""That I think has a really important thing",Ted
10:11,"""to say about oceans."" And so voom, I would use that energy. And so I've actually really enjoyed",Ted
10:19,"making use of my fame, you know?",Ted
10:19,I like that.,Lacey
10:19,"Just like other people might I get to use it, too, and I use it that way",Ted
10:27,and it's very effective.,Ted
10:27,"What would you guys do with anonymity for a day? What's the thing, I mean.",Don
10:27,"I mean, I think I feel",Don
10:34,like I kinda have it.,Don
10:34,You do?,Lacey
10:34,I have it when I sleep.,Jim
10:34,"Yeah, yours is a little tricky.",Don
10:40,"So Jim, what would you do?",Lacey
10:40,Even my dog makes a big deal. (group laughing),Jim
10:40,"What would you do, Jim?",Lacey
10:40,"He's home, he's home!",Don
10:40,If you had a day where nobody would recognize you?,Lacey
10:48,"I don't think I'd be that different, honestly. I operate, I dropped the whole trying to be something",Jim
10:55,"for somebody a long time ago, so I pretty much walk through the world except when I wanna be funny",Jim
11:00,"or I wanna do something outrageous, you know, kinda tip the boat, you know? I don't have any trouble being myself,",Jim
11:06,and I don't have any trouble saying no when I mean no. I don't feel there is a pressing responsibility,Jim
11:15,"to please everyone, I'm not unkind to people. I love people, I would much prefer saying ""hello""",Jim
11:22,"and ""who are you"" and ""what are you doing today?""",Jim
11:22,Than selfies.,Don
11:22,Than giving a selfie because selfies stop the world.,Jim
11:29,"You know, they stop life. You then go like that and it's going on Instagram",Jim
11:35,to give people a false sense of relevance. I picture Steve Jobs sometimes.,Jim
11:41,Everybody's so gaga about Steve Jobs. I picture him in hell running from demons who want a selfie.,Jim
11:49,And that's something I have to kind of live with. Nothing to do with the person that comes up,Jim
11:56,because they're programmed to react to celebrity that way. They don't even think of another way to react.,Jim
12:02,"I see it completely differently. When people come up and you look them in the eye, and you look them in the eye for three seconds.",Henry
12:08,Presence.,Jim
12:08,"They believe that they are with you, and when they meet me,",Henry
12:14,"and I'm really now calm enough to be present, they are very happy because of something I've done.",Henry
12:22,"I've made them laugh, they sat with their grandmother, they sat with their dad, they sat with the family,",Henry
12:28,"whatever it is, and that is a lovely thing.",Henry
12:28,"So I'm an asshole, is that what you're trying to say?",Jim
12:34,[Henry] So if they want to take the picture.,Henry
12:34,"I'm an asshole, is that what you're? (group laughing)",Jim
12:34,"No, I would not say that.",Henry
12:39,That's not I wanna say at all. I think you're very interesting.,Henry
12:44,(group laughing),
12:44,But if you say no to the selfie or like,Don
12:44,I do.,Henry
12:44,"Or like, I just don't wanna take are they,",Don
12:49,cause I've done that.,Don
12:49,That's what I find is presence is good.,Jim
12:49,"I get that, and I get like",Don
12:49,"No, because I always tell them why.",Henry
12:57,"I say, you know what, I'd love to but I cannot take it in this restaurant because when you walk away everybody saw you do it",Henry
13:04,and I will never finish my meal. So thank you so much for asking.,Henry
13:04,[Don] I get an eye roll if I say stuff like that,Don
13:10,You do?,Henry
13:10,"I've just gone on to, I look at whatever",Don
13:10,I will go with you and I will be your front man.,Henry
13:10,Then I'll be with you.,Don
13:15,It was my birthday last month.,Jim
13:15,"When they come up with an iPhone I say, ""Oh, I have a contract with Samsung. ""I would love to."" (group laughing)",Don
13:22,I can't.,Don
13:22,Oh I'm using that. That's good.,Ted
13:22,I like that.,Lacey
13:22,Just throw it down and dance on it.,Jim
13:22,A lot of you have played these really,Lacey
13:27,"sort of indelible roles on iconic projects. I'm looking at you, but you, there's many of you",Lacey
13:33,"at this table, what are the unexpected pieces of the moving on process?",Lacey
13:33,(gasps) I was on Happy Days,Henry
13:40,for 10 years.,Henry
13:40,Wow.,Don
13:40,"I committed hubris. I thought not that I was great,",Henry
13:46,but that it was such a big show and it was so international.,Henry
13:46,It was everywhere.,Henry
13:46,That I was going to go,Henry
13:52,from mountaintop to mountaintop. I was going to beat the system. I looked down and there were grass stains,Henry
13:58,"on the knees of my jeans 'cause I slid right into the valley, it was very difficult to get hired",Henry
14:04,"as an actor, and I had no plan B. I was seven years old, I dreamt of doing this thing.",Henry
14:12,I did it and I did it with an explosion. Now it's over and I had no idea how or what to do next.,Henry
14:21,"Was the show being so syndicated everywhere on all the time, was that a reminder for you?",Jim
14:28,No.,Henry
14:28,"Was that a feeling of like, I mean, I'm sure you felt blessed by it.",Jim
14:28,I was blessed by it.,HEnry
14:28,"But at the same time,",Jim
14:34,it's reminding you,Jim
14:34,"No, they did a good job of reminding me all on their own. (group laughing)",Henry
14:40,"No, thank you so much, was a big reminder.",Henry
14:40,Cause it was everywhere.,Jim
14:40,I didn't need a rerun.,Henry
14:40,"Everywhere, yeah.",?
14:40,It was ridiculous.,Jim
14:45,"Sunday, Monday, Happy Days. Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days. Thursday, Friday, Happy Days. ‚ô™ Happy days, happy days ‚ô™",Jim
14:52,(Jim and Don vocalizing),
14:52,Okay.,Don
14:52,Sorry.,?
14:52,What about for you?,Lacey
14:52,"I was lucky 'cause my character's job was to look at the crazy,",Ted
14:59,"wonderful, extreme characters around me. I was the audience's way into the show, Sam was.",Ted
15:07,So I wasn't playing such an iconic character. That allowed me to move on.,Ted
15:12,"I wasn't wacky Sam, not that you were wacky, but",Ted
15:12,"[Henry] No, I totally get what you're saying.",Henry
15:12,But iconic and I was,Ted
15:12,I totally get,Henry
15:18,what you're saying,Henry
15:18,"Eyes in, so it was easier, I think, for me.",Ted
15:18,Hollywood likes to sort of lock people in lanes.,Lacey
15:24,"They want something, a specific thing from you. Most often it's because you've given it to them before.",Lacey
15:32,"What are the things that you get approached for that you just say, oh, not this again.",Lacey
15:37,"I'm grateful for every opportunity, but I will tell you I have turned down a bunch of offers or auditions for things that",Timothy
15:44,"are just bad versions of the things that I'm doing already. Like, if there is just too much of a Venn diagram overlap I do somewhat reject it out of hand.",Timothy
15:50,Sure.,Henry
15:50,Oh here's like a sort of gangly guy who's gonna say sexually inappropriate stuff in an office and he's gonna wear a suit.,Lacey
15:55,"Like okay, well, I'm doing that already.",Timothy
15:55,And a really good version of that.,Lacey
15:55,"And also this version of me is not as funny, so like, I'm sure we all try to like",Timothy
16:03,I've done several of the parts you turned down.,Ted
16:03,Yeah. (group laughing),Timothy
16:03,"[Lacey] Done well, yes.",Lacey
16:09,"You know, I mean there is that thing of like I do, although it does involve saying no to work",Timothy
16:15,"which I never, ever thought I would be in a position to do. I have tried to be cognizant of it",Timothy
16:21,"since the beginning of the show, do you know what I mean?",Timothy
16:21,Absolutely.,Henry
16:21,Yeah.,?
16:21,Yeah.,?
16:21,I think I went through a period of getting multi,Sacha
16:21,character ideas.,Sacha
16:30,"So there'd be films where, hey Sacha, here's your idea in which you're gonna play 10 characters. (group laughing) I get 10 characters.",Sacha
16:36,One of them is Eddie Murphy.,Jim
16:36,"Yeah, exactly. Okay, this takes a long time. You know, so there was a period",Sacha
16:41,"where multiple character movies and I think there was no understanding that it takes time, and obviously some of 'em",Sacha
16:47,"are gonna work and some aren't. And then we've been offered, and at one point I think after Borat, because Borat",Sacha
16:53,was the first openly anti,Sacha
16:53,"Semitic character, that I suddenly started getting Jewish characters",Sacha
16:59,"as if somehow I was the only Jew in Hollywood. So there was a lot of, you know, will you play this Jewish character or this Jewish character?",Sacha
17:05,I think somehow Borat being anti,Sacha
17:05,Semitic made me appear that I'd be very good at a Jewish character.,Sacha
17:11,"All of a sudden you were really, really",Henry
17:11,"I was Mr. Jewish, yes, yeah, yeah.",Sacha
17:16,"You killed it man, amazing. And I love that movie so much and I love you.",Jim
17:22,"Thank you, and likewise.",Sacha
17:22,I love your approach to uncomfortable people and subjects and the way you,Jim
17:27,Scaring the crap out of us.,Ted
17:27,"You just laid bare the people who are supposed to be in control and aren't,",Jim
17:34,and I love it.,Jim
17:34,Thank you very much. That's a huge...,Sacha
17:34,What would you like to play?,Henry
17:40,"I mean, in your fantasy, what would you like to play?",Henry
17:40,Probably things I'd like to play,Sacha
17:45,"I probably wouldn't be very good at playing, but I don't know, I think something that is,",Sacha
17:51,"when I was at university, because obviously you're not in a box there, I would play",Sacha
17:58,in the amateur dramatic stuff I would play this genre that was called tragedy comedy which is,Sacha
18:03,"something like Cyrano de Bergerac or even like Fiddler on the Roof. You have the character starts off as really funny,",Sacha
18:11,"the audience love them, and in the second a tragedy happens and then because the audience love you",Sacha
18:19,and are engaged with you more because you've made them laugh they transition really quickly into getting sad and crying.,Sacha
18:26,"So my eyesight's not very good and I remember playing Cyrano de Bergerac and I didn't know what these white, I'd see bits of white coming up.",Sacha
18:33,"And I'd go, what are they? And they go, they were tissues. They were starting to cry. But it's a genre that you don't really see much anymore",Sacha
18:40,"which obviously existed back then which is the idea of funny people who can then,",Sacha
18:46,because you've kind of got the audience by the kishkas you can then turn it around and get them crying.,Sacha
18:53,So I think something like that would be,Sacha
18:53,Can I coin a phrase?,Jim
18:53,Please.,Sacha
18:53,Calamedy.,Jim
18:53,I love it.,Sacha
18:59,That's what I look at it as. That's my show is calamedy.,Jim
18:59,"Yeah. It's about a calamity, and it's handled with humor",Jim
19:10,"and levity and pretty much that's what I do. You know, every trauma, and I could build a ladder",Jim
19:20,"to the stars with the things that have happened or the things that I've had to endure,",Jim
19:26,but they've all turned into something really creative.,Jim
19:26,That's great.,Henry
19:26,"You know, the worst injury",Jim
19:32,"I've ever had I went to the art studio and I made a painting, you know, and I sat there and I went, I wish people could be here to see what that process is,",Jim
19:42,"what happens to an artist when they get hurt, you know? They don't try to lash out most of the time.",Jim
19:49,They try to turn it into a bouquet of flowers. That's what I wanna do.,Jim
19:54,I wanna turn it into something that,Jim
19:54,"And I think that's good, probably to some degree for all of us here that you do get to work through",Ted
20:02,your life and your emotions and through your art. It's pretty cool.,Ted
20:02,"Yeah, and alchemize it.",Jim
20:08,"That's what I meant by we are a mirror because the more you are, I mean,",Henry
20:13,I finally defined cool by cool is being authentic. And the more authentic we are as the character we play,Henry
20:21,"everybody, no matter man, woman, child, they all say, oh my God, I see myself",Henry
20:27,cause we are all the same.,Henry
20:27,Yeah.,Lacey
20:27,And so that really is positive that you take,Henry
20:33,all of that pain and make it into an art that people then can thrive through.,Henry
20:39,"Yeah, I think I'd say that the show that I just did, Who Is America? A guy called Donald Trump got elected and I was upset by it",Sacha
20:47,"and that anger and disappointment and revulsion,",Sacha
20:53,"I was expressing it by sort of sending friends emails, you know, sharing articles, look at this and this.",Sacha
20:59,"And in the end I felt, I was so angry I felt I actually have to channel that into",Sacha
21:05,some characters.,Sacha
21:05,Right.,Jim
21:05,Aimed at,Sacha
21:05,Exposing.,Don
21:05,"Who could sit with some of those people, you know,",Sacha
21:11,cause I wanted to sit with those people who were his friends.,Sacha
21:11,Right.,?
21:11,"And that was actually,",Sacha
21:18,"you know, what you sometimes do through other artistic means I was like, it was strange 'cause I'd come out of a period",Sacha
21:24,"of doing a bunch of movies like, I have to go back to this old style of comedy that's difficult for me to do, but I have to do it",Sacha
21:33,"because I'm so upset, you know?",Sacha
21:33,Yeah.,Jim
21:33,"So that was my, it was a like, I actually didn't really care",Sacha
21:42,"how the show went down, I mean, SHOWTIME's gonna be upset about this. I said to them, okay, I go, I'm not doing any publicity",Sacha
21:48,"because I just had to get it out of my system, you know?",Sacha
21:48,Today we're gonna teach you,omit
21:54,how you can stop these naughty men and have them take a long nap.,omit
21:54,"That's right, and that's why you're going to need",omit
22:01,"a friend of mine, his name is Puppy Pistol. Now, Philip, will you show us how to feed Puppy Pistol.",omit
22:10,"To feed him, take his lunchbox and push it into his tummy like this, just remember to point Puppy Pistol's mouth",omit
22:19,right at the middle of the bad man.,omit
22:19,"I'm curious if you're sitting with the various people you've sat with, when did you know that you had struck gold?",Lacey
22:29,"I mean, I know in the case of Sarah Palin you felt like you didn't have it. What made you realize, okay, in this one, got it.",Lacey
22:35,"What were you looking for, what was success?",Lacey
22:35,"You feel it in the room, I mean,",Sacha
22:41,the difference of doing stuff on stage and the stuff that we do is we kinda know when it's funny,Sacha
22:47,"cause people aren't allowed to laugh around us otherwise they ruin the take. Now obviously, you know, there's no one else around this,",Sacha
22:54,"just the cameramen, but you instinctively know if it's funny and also if you've got enough.",Sacha
23:00,But is funny the goal or is exposing somebody the goal? What's the goal?,Lacey
23:00,"There's two of them. It has to be, for me, I love being funny",Sacha
23:09,"so it has to be funny and then if I can get something that interests me, then I'm very satisfied with that.",Sacha
23:18,"I wouldn't say happy, but you know, if a politician drops his underpants and charges",Sacha
23:27,"It's unbelievable what you are able to do and how you are able to get people to,",Don
23:33,or maybe it's not unbelievable because these people are just waiting for an opportunity to share their truth.,Don
23:33,"Right, yeah.",Timothy
23:33,On the stage.,Don
23:40,"But that the amount of truth, the amount of touching",Don
23:45,"the nerve that you're able to do that we can watch at home. I'm just cringing when I watch your show, in a great way.",Don
23:45,"Yeah, thank you, truly.",Sacha
23:45,"Yeah, laughing and cringing.",Don
23:52,"And yet you've said, when you get O.J. Simpson sitting across from you and you're disappointed",Lacey
23:57,that he doesn't confess to murder.,Lacey
23:57,I didn't say I was disappointed.,Sacha
24:02:00,I had an absurdly ambitious aim (group laughing) which was to get OJ to,Sacha
24:11:00,A Perry Mason ending.,Jim
24:11:00,And then I shot that right at the end of the show and I had had achieved,Sacha
24:19:00,"some things that I was surprised by, so I never thought that a politician would get his buttocks out and charge, I never.",Sacha
24:25:00,I was surprised by a lot of,Sacha
24:25:00,The art dealer with the public hair.,Jim
24:25:00,Yeah.,?
24:25:00,Oh my God.,Don
24:25:00,Was just too much for me.,Jim
24:25:00,"Okay, so",Lacey
24:25:00,"I do like the idea that a bunch of people were like,",Timothy
24:32:00,has anybody just asked OJ if he did it? Has anybody just asked him?,Timothy
24:32:00,"That's why I thought I'd go,",Sacha
24:37:00,could I,Sacha
24:37:00,Just get him wrecked.,Jim
24:37:00,Could I,Sacha
24:37:00,"Get him shit faced, just ask him.",Don
24:37:00,"Well, he can't get wrecked",Sacha
24:43:00,because once he gets wrecked then he's violating the terms of his parole.,Sacha
24:43:00,"Oh, I see.",Jim
24:43:00,"So, I did try to, but I still trained up with an FBI interrogator.",Sacha
24:51:00,"Oh, wow.",Don
24:51:00,"Because I thought, and again this is reaching too high, but I thought, let me try it",Sacha
25:00:00,"because it was hidden camera. I though, would he, if he's ever going to admit it",Sacha
25:06:00,it would be in a hotel room where he thinks he's gonna earn a lot of money and so I trained up,Sacha
25:12:00,"with supposedly the greatest FBI interrogator and eventually he goes, ""Well who's this for?"" And I go, ""It's for O.J.""",Sacha
25:18:00,"He goes, ""That's gonna be tough, but okay."" And then he sort of trained me up. I didn't manage to get him to confess to the alleged",Sacha
25:27:00,"He's not in your ear, there's no earwig. You went in and just did it.",Don
25:27:00,"Well, the FBI have a way",Sacha
25:32:00,with people who are finding it hard to confess to actually get them to,Sacha
25:32:00,"Wow, to give it up.",Don
25:38:00,"To admit to stuff, so there is a sequence that I'd memorized to try and get O.J. to, but it failed.",Sacha
25:48:00,"But that you'd gone through that much of a, 'cause it doesn't look like that. That's the only thing, it doesn't look like, wow,",Don
25:54:00,he's checking off a bunch of boxes. It just looks like you're having a conversation.,Don
25:54:00,Yes.,Sacha
25:54:00,But it's clearly,Don
25:59:00,"a real skill because these people just vary with no,",Don
26:05:00,"very fastly just move into these places where you're like, I would never say, I would never",Don
26:05:00,So what's the sequence?,Lacey
26:05:00,Well obviously the sequence,Sacha
26:14:00,is,Sacha
26:14:00,"You just say, come on. Like, come on.",Timothy
26:14:00,"Yeah, come on. A lot of questions, come on.",Sacha
26:14:00,Seriously.,?
26:19:00,Just you and me.,Jim
26:19:00,"What he said, yeah.",Sacha
26:19:00,That was basically part of the thing. Part of the thing was,Sacha
26:19:00,"Come on,",?
26:24:00,"then you say, come on.",?
26:24:00,"He said I didn't kill a guy. Come on, it might be that she just got really depressed, walked into the body bag, zipped herself up",Sacha
26:31:00,"and threw herself off the yacht, you know. And then suppose it is being blase about the murder.",Sacha
26:39:00,Right.,Don
26:39:00,And then part of it is there's a kind of incremental series of questions,Sacha
26:45:00,"where you say, you know, how did you get away with what you did that night?",Sacha
26:51:00,"And then you go, how did you get away with what you did to them that night. And then, it's sort of an incredible art, but he never admitted.",Sacha
26:59:00,I'm just sorta nervous now to be sitting around the table.,Timothy
26:59:00,"I know, I know.",Ted
26:59:00,Yeah.,?
26:59:00,You're gonna start asking me questions.,Timothy
26:59:00,Hey Ted and Sacha. (mimics phone slamming),Ted
27:05:00,"I'm hoping you'll tear me open, man. I can't live with this anymore. (warm instrumental music)",Jim
27:15:00,When were the last time you guys were sort of genuinely nervous to tell a story,Lacey
27:20:00,or maybe it's how the story would be received.,Lacey
27:20:00,[Don] Yes.,Don
27:20:00,"Yes, and. (group laughs)",Lacey
27:27:00,"Yes, I mean, yeah, if you're really gonna be honest and truthful I think you're",Don
27:27:00,So when was,Lacey
27:33:00,Kinda putting yourself out there.,Don
27:33:00,Give me an example of when that was.,Lacey
27:33:00,[Timothy] Do you mean like real life or work,Timothy
27:33:00,wise?,Timothy
27:33:00,"No, work",Lacey
27:33:00,wise.,Lacey
27:33:00,Work,Timothy
27:33:00,"wise, okay.",Timothy
27:40:00,"I've only ever been disappointed when I wasn't authentic, when I had reached for something that was not based",Jim
27:49:00,"in some authenticity, even if it's a wildly animated character.",Jim
27:49:00,What did that look like?,Lacey
27:49:00,If it isn't based in some sort of reality,Jim
27:58:00,then I feel I've raped myself.,Jim
27:58:00,Which is painful.,Sacha
27:58:00,"Yes, it's difficult for some.",Jim
28:06:00,"But you know, that's when I feel really uncomfortable when I'm on a track that isn't authentic.",Jim
28:12:00,But it takes a while.,Henry
28:12:00,Yeah.,Jim
28:12:00,To get to that realization.,Henry
28:12:00,I'd never been disappointed,Jim
28:18:00,ever with authenticity.,Jim
28:18:00,Right.,Henry
28:18:00,And I was really frightened about it until a few years ago,Jim
28:24:00,when I started kinda sharing how I feel about things and my truth and there was a voice telling me,Jim
28:31:00,"that if I actually didn't score, if I didn't hit a funny line every at least 30 seconds",Jim
28:38:00,"they would think I was pompous and they would turn against me and say, who they fuck do you think you are?",Jim
28:45:00,"And I've never had that reaction, ever.",Jim
28:45:00,"I'd like to ask a question actually to you, which is that your style of performance",Sacha
28:52:00,"was completely unique, like you'd never seen somebody give, first he's absolutely roll on the floor funny",Sacha
28:59:00,"but you'd never seen anybody give as, put as much energy into",Sacha
28:59:00,"Yeah, physical, vocal,",Don
29:06:00,"all of it, yeah.",Don
29:06:00,"For it to be physical. I mean, it was like seeing an electricity somehow unleashed",Sacha
29:06:00,Whirling Dervish.,Henry
29:13:00,"So I'm interested, when you were in the middle of performance did your state change?",Sacha
29:20:00,What was the feeling when you're,Sacha
29:20:00,"It was a like a fugue state, really, it's like a fugue state, but you know I",Jim
29:26:00,"Like a what, sorry?",Sacha
29:26:00,Fugue state.,Don
29:26:00,Like a fugue state.,Jim
29:26:00,"Thank you, yeah.",Sacha
29:26:00,Like you wake up afterwards.,Jim
29:26:00,Yeah.,Sacha
29:32:00,"You know, and go, what happened?",Jim
29:32:00,That's what it looked like.,Sacha
29:32:00,"But it was, you know, Ace Ventura was a way to rip down arrogance",Jim
29:41:00,"and that, you know, the powers that be in any case and at the same time it's pure love.",Jim
29:52:00,"There's so much love in it, in that mocking except for the one I'm mocking necessarily,",Jim
29:58:00,"but even them I just wanna go, you know this is bullshit, right? You know you're full of it.",Jim
30:06:00,"But the performance is love, it's a dance for me. And I love actors who employed",Jim
30:13:00,"every bit of their instrument, you know, I mean, you look at James Dean, this is a man who was expressing",Jim
30:20:00,"everything with every, you know, he didn't just get emotional, he was emotion.",Jim
30:26:00,"It was tearing him apart! You know, and it was everything was in it, and I love that kind of thing, so I always think of myself",Jim
30:33:00,"as a kind of painting, you know? And it's an abstract painting a lot of times.",Jim
30:40:00,"So I know the method, I know Stanislavski",Jim
30:45:00,and I know Meisner and I know what's good from them for me.,Jim
30:51:00,"I use it, and at the same time I'm painting. So don't tell me the eyes can't both be",Jim
30:57:00,on this side of the head.,Jim
30:57:00,"I think sort of unlike any other comic performance I think in television,",Sacha
31:04:00,"film history I've never really seen that kind of energy exuded, I mean, it's hilarious,",Sacha
31:11:00,but I think it's completely unique.,Sacha
31:11:00,"It was so unique for me, it was so unique that when I first saw it I went,",Ted
31:16:00,"""Oh, no, no, no, no,"" turned it off. And then I came back and turned it on again.",Ted
31:22:00,"I mean, it literally took me a while to go, oh fuck, look at this.",Ted
31:22:00,This can't happen!,Jim
31:28:00,It was so new to my eyes.,Ted
31:28:00,You can't do that!,?
31:28:00,"It was like, it took me.",Ted
31:28:00,"Well, I had the most wonderful experience before Ace came out.",Jim
31:37:00,I was in Chicago doing a live gig. My manager sat me down at a restaurant in Chicago,Jim
31:42:00,"and they said, ""We got kinda bad news. ""Siskel and Ebert killed you"" And don't know what's next from here.",Jim
31:51:00,This was before Ace Ventura.,Sacha
31:51:00,Three days before it came out they had the words on a page.,Jim
31:57:00,"And I just looked and it said, the worst movie ever made. Worst actor ever made, this is the end.",Jim
32:05:00,This is whatever.,Jim
32:05:00,"It was completely original. No one had seen it, so.",Jim
32:05:00,It was so scathing.,Jim
32:10:00,"I've been disappointed so many times in my career I have an automatic downshift. I go, well, okay, don't know how it's gonna happen,",Jim
32:18:00,but I'm gonna have to break a basement window or something. And what happened to my just absolute delight,Jim
32:26:00,was that by the time I had done Truman Show Siskel and Ebert did an entire episode just about me,Jim
32:36:00,"and called it Jim Carrey, Clown With Class. And I get emotional thinking about that.",Jim
32:42:00,"It was incredible, like they just said, we were wrong. And I've never seen a critic say that.",Jim
32:48:00,"But of them said, we were wrong. We didn't know what we were seeing.",Jim
32:48:00,That's validation.,Lacey
32:48:00,And that's just a wonderful thing.,Jim
32:48:00,So I'd asked about,Lacey
32:55:00,"what makes you nervous, I'm curious, in your case, I mean, you took on, I guess it's the antidote",Lacey
33:01:00,"to the Me Too movement with the Not Me movement. But I am curious sort of in that,",Lacey
33:07:00,"and I believe that started on some level as your idea. Do you get nervous, do you think about",Lacey
33:12:00,"where that line is, what is that navigation?",Lacey
33:12:00,"Well, I mean, I think like sort of specifically to this show I've never worried only because the writers",Timothy
33:20:00,involved are so good at handling those kinds of things and always making sure that the joke is on the right person.,Timothy
33:27:00,"So I never, I think having a back stop of talent like is in our writers room is incredible.",Timothy
33:34:00,But as a performer I never really have gotten nervous about it just because ultimately the joke,Timothy
33:40:00,is never on any of the people he is saying terrible things about. It's always on how terrible of a person he is.,Timothy
33:47:00,He is.,Lacey
33:47:00,Yeah. (crowd applauding),omit
33:47:00,"Go ahead, say something.",Omit
33:47:00,"Oh, no thank you.",omit
33:47:00,"Yeah, no, you have to, they'd love it, you have to.",omit
33:55:00,"Look at how hot she is! Yeah, I get sprung.",omit
33:55:00,"Oh gosh, thank you all",omit
34:00:00,"so much, my Jonie, he just swept me off my feet. And I know that when he's elected president",omit
34:06:00,"he's gonna sweep all the dirt out of Washington, so (crowd cheering) we're just gonna need",omit
34:11:00,to find a broom that's tall enough for him. (crowd laughing),omit
34:11:00,I just want to make it clear that she,omit
34:17:00,does do all the housework.,omit
34:17:00,I do.,omit
34:17:00,Because it's politics and not only US politics but then world politics there is not a single thing,Timothy
34:23:00,"under the sun that we can't be cynical about. And moving forward, I think I will miss that a little bit.",Timothy
34:29:00,There's no side to it either. Everybody's in the frying pan.,Jim
34:29:00,Right.,Timothy
34:29:00,That's terrible.,Lacey
34:29:00,Everybody is in there.,Timothy
34:36:00,"I will miss that level of cynicism, but at the same time I am looking forward to not being so cynical",Timothy
34:42:00,"about every single thing that you come in contact. But yeah, I do think that nobody in making,",Timothy
34:48:00,like the Not Me joke wants to have a joke on the victims. Nobody would think that was funny.,Timothy
34:54:00,"So I do think that from the beginning it was just like, oh, they found a really good way to do that. I just had a dumb, I was like in my backyard.",Timothy
35:01:00,I was raking and I had a dumb pitch and I called up our showrunner and pitched him the very beginning of it and they built it out,Timothy
35:08:00,into what it became.,Timothy
35:08:00,Ballsy.,Jim
35:08:00,With you I've heard you say that your showrunners sort of take storylines or jokes,Lacey
35:15:00,"and they take it as far as they can possibly go, and then you sort of rein them in and you say, you can say that, I'm.",Lacey
35:15:00,You're on camera.,Don
35:21:00,You can say that joke. (group laughing) You wanna come in and do that one? I gotta walk around in the space of that.,Don
35:27:00,"No, I'm not doing that.",Don
35:27:00,"I mean, can you give us some examples of that and where your line is?",Lacey
35:27:00,And ruin it right now?,Don
35:27:00,"Yeah, let's go",Sacha
35:33:00,for that Seth and Evan.,Sacha
35:33:00,"Yeah, set your career on fire, no, they just push hard and I think they do it",Don
35:39:00,"because you don't really know where the line is sometimes until you've stepped over it and you go, oh, that was the line, I guess we're over here now.",Don
35:46:00,But I think that the protection is always that the joke is always on the people,Don
35:51:00,"that are saying the line, we're not making fun of the people that are the subject of it.",Don
35:56:00,"It's that these people are so blind to, they have no self awareness that they are hilarious",Don
36:04:00,"because they're trying to process this through their prism of blindness, and that's why they are hilarious, you know.",Don
36:09:00,They are the people who are the joke. Both of the writers are Jewish and they like to throw in some anti,Don
36:09:00,Semitic jokes.,Don
36:09:00,"Oh, they're the worst.",Sacha
36:16:00,"And I'm like, I'm not doing that. You can say that one, I'll make it the Black joke.",Don
36:21:00,"Another thing that happens in your show is a tremendous amount of drugs, of cocaine",Lacey
36:27:00,"and I remember hearing Seth Rogen, one of your producers say that cocaine in the '80s",Lacey
36:32:00,is much funnier than cocaine today.,Lacey
36:32:00,Correct.,Don
36:32:00,"A, why, and B,",Lacey
36:38:00,"what are the sort of unexpected challenges of playing high, and I'm guessing there's other people",Lacey
36:43:00,at this table who have,Lacey
36:43:00,"Oh, yes.",Don
36:43:00,I'm so blasted right now.,Jim
36:43:00,You all.,Don
36:43:00,"I didn't mean now, I meant.",Lacey
36:43:00,You're freaking me,Jim
36:50:00,the fuck out. (group laughing) Can we move on?,Jim
36:50:00,You look like a talking sponge.,Don
36:56:00,"That's why this came up, isn't it?",Jim
36:56:00,"Yeah, yeah.",Lacey
36:56:00,"For sure, sorry.",Lacey
36:56:00,"No, it's, yeah, I think it's funny then",Don
37:02:00,"because we are now, because we're here and we can see where it's headed and going, that's not gonna work out well for you.",Don
37:10:00,"I know you think now that this is brilliant juice, but it's not gonna work out.",Don
37:10:00,It drove the industry in the '70s.,Jim
37:10:00,Exactly.,Don
37:16:00,And it was,Jim
37:16:00,"I mean, I know people that were when I started, I'm not gonna say who in the show, but they were getting their per diem in coke.",Don
37:23:00,Yeah.,Jim
37:23:00,The prop truck was where you got your cocaine.,Ted
37:23:00,"To go, of course.",Don
37:23:00,What?,Lacey
37:23:00,Absolutely.,Don
37:23:00,I'm not trying,Timothy
37:29:00,"to be a square, but my God, I feel like I have 1/2 a glass of wine",Timothy
37:34:00,"and I worry about call the next morning, like I'm such a loser.",Timothy
37:34:00,"It was just the culture of it, it was just like do it.",Don
37:34:00,"Well, you gotta be deep",Jim
37:40:00,into the addiction to actually be able to handle it.,Jim
37:40:00,"Yeah, that's true. (group laughing)",Timothy
37:40:00,"You'll get there, kids, you'll get there.",Don
37:46:00,Plenty far along.,Jim
37:46:00,"Okay, but what about it playing on screen?",Lacey
37:46:00,"There's hope for you, yet.",Timothy
37:46:00,"Yeah, there's hope, you'll get there.",Timothy
37:46:00,"Is that fun, easy, or is that harder than?",Lacey
37:55:00,"You know, you're kinda wired already. And the B12 doing it over and over again.",Don
38:02:00,And it can kind of get you on.,Don
38:02:00,That's what you take?,Lacey
38:02:00,Approximating the high.,Don
38:02:00,That's what it is?,Lacey
38:02:00,"Yeah, it's B, or coke.",Don
38:02:00,"Or actual coke,",Lacey
38:09:00,one of the two.,Lacey
38:09:00,"Like Jim said, if you're already there, then your tolerance is so high that you need a little help, then you know",Don
38:14:00,Powdered elephant tusk.,Jim
38:14:00,Exactly.,Don
38:14:00,That line you were talking about.,Ted
38:14:00,That's the line.,Don
38:14:00,"Yeah, right.",Jim
38:14:00,"Oh, I just stepped over and it's about that thick",Don
38:21:00,"and it's a rail, it's not actually a line. (laughing)",Don
38:21:00,Yeah.,Ted
38:21:00,Jim was talking a bit about this validation of hearing,Lacey
38:29:00,from the people who perhaps earlier in your career didn't have the same things to say about you.,Lacey
38:34:00,"I'm curious, you got on stage having won the Emmy. You pulled out of your pocket a speech",Lacey
38:39:00,that was one that you had written decades ago. How much of that was career validation for you?,Lacey
38:47:00,"I loved winning it. It sits on my dining room table, which is directly opposite the front door.",Henry
38:55:00,So when the man delivers my Lipitor he gets to see it. (group laughing),Henry
39:03:00,"But that's it, I never thought, oh, I deserve it. I never thought, oh, it took so long.",Henry
39:09:00,"I thought, okay, in this moment I've won it. I'll tell you what I was not prepared for.",Henry
39:15:00,"When you're nominated you think that is great. Everybody says, oh my gosh, just to be nominated.",Henry
39:20:00,It's an honor.,Lacey
39:20:00,Which only lasts until your tush hits the seat and then you want it.,Henry
39:28:00,But people treat you differently when you have won it.,Henry
39:34:00,How so?,Lacey
39:34:00,"I don't know. They literally treat you different. Oh my God, and I'm talking about on the street,",Henry
39:41:00,"in the industry, when you are an Emmy winner there is something, a patina they put on you",Henry
39:50:00,"that I thought, this is strange.",Henry
39:50:00,Do you get a car?,Don
39:50:00,Huh?,Henry
39:50:00,Do you get a car?,Don
39:50:00,I didn't get a car.,Henry
39:56:00,Oh.,Don
39:56:00,I didn't get a car.,Henry
39:56:00,"I had a different, I was nominated nine times in a row",Ted
40:02:00,before I won.,Ted
40:02:00,Right.,Henry
40:02:00,"And when I won people would say,",Ted
40:09:00,"well you have, like what, 10 of them, right? People don't know.",Ted
40:09:00,Right.,Henry
40:09:00,Yeah.,Don
40:09:00,"People don't, and my experience was like",Ted
40:09:00,They didn't know,Henry
40:16:00,you didn't win before.,Henry
40:16:00,"Yeah, and the mantle of you were robbed was taken from me when I won.",Ted
40:23:00,(group laughing) And you were robbed was kind of a nice...,Ted
40:23:00,"No, I don't know, the you were robbed thing",Jim
40:29:00,is a little bit tiresome.,Jim
40:29:00,"You know, I enjoyed it.",Ted
40:29:00,Because you don't enter this business for awards you know?,Jim
40:35:00,Tell some other boy tonight that you were robbed.,Ted
40:35:00,Can't use that love anymore.,Don
40:35:00,I never felt robbed.,Henry
40:42:00,I was just happy that I won when I won. And when I turned around and I could feel the warmth,Henry
40:50:00,and the pressure of having almost no time to give the speech,Henry
40:56:00,"and the only thing that I wrote 43 years ago was, kids, you can go to bed now, and of course the kids are now 35, 37, and 40, and 47.",Henry
41:04:00,They're already in bed.,Don
41:04:00,"Yeah, they're already in.",?
41:04:00,"I was there that night, I was robbed.",Ted
41:10:00,(group laughing),
41:10:00,In these characters that you are currently inhabiting,Lacey
41:15:00,"what are the pieces of yourselves, consciously or not, that you have sorta infused into them?",Lacey
41:22:00,"The demon that I play, the eternal demon?",Ted
41:22:00,"Yes, that one.",Lacey
41:22:00,That seems like a one,Timothy
41:22:00,to,Timothy
41:22:00,one for me just having this for a few times.,Timothy
41:29:00,"Yeah, was the performance.",Sacha
41:29:00,"When people ask, ""What's your process?"" Nowadays I try the words on over and over",Ted
41:35:00,and over again and slowly if the words are really well,Ted
41:35:00,"written words, which I've been blessed with,",Ted
41:40:00,the words start to inform me. It becomes a dance that comes out of doing the words enough time that you then perform it.,Ted
41:47:00,"I get to play this character Michael, and if I do the words well then some sort of character",Ted
41:55:00,"comes out and I'm enjoying it in the moment so I guess I'm there in the moment,",Ted
42:01:00,but I can't say that I...,Ted
42:01:00,There are pieces of you in it.,Lacey
42:01:00,Cause I just found out this week that underneath my human skin suit,Ted
42:08:00,"that I make myself more palatable to the humans, I'm a two",Ted
42:08:00,"story fiery squid, so, you know.",Ted
42:16:00,[Don] That's what I would've guessed.,Don
42:16:00,What draws you to that role? What do you see?,Lacey
42:16:00,It wasn't the role.,Ted
42:23:00,"We signed on to Mike Schur's idea. He literally talked to us for two hours in a room. There was no script and we went, okay.",Ted
42:30:00,"And I'm really glad I did because it's about something. It's about decency, it's about there are ripple effects,",Ted
42:38:00,"there are consequences to your actions. And in this kind of day and age is really, it's a lovely,",Ted
42:45:00,it's disguised in nine,Ted
42:45:00,year,Ted
42:45:00,"old fart humor and lots of visual magic, but we are talking",Ted
42:50:00,about something that matters.,Ted
42:50:00,Who are you really?,Omit
42:56:00,"All right, all right, fine, just give me one more second.",omit
42:56:00,One.,omit
42:56:00,Serious question.,omit
42:56:00,Yeah.,omit
43:01:00,Should we kill them?,omit
43:01:00,What?,omit
43:01:00,"It might work. We kill them, go back through the door, somehow grab them before they get to the bad place",omit
43:09:00,"and regroup from there, I could kill them right now. You know, it would be easy, their bodies are very poorly made.",omit
43:14:00,They're mostly goo and juice. You just take the juice out and then they're dead.,omit
43:14:00,"Jim, you said if the Jeff Pickles role were presented",Lacey
43:21:00,"a few years before it ultimately was you wouldn't have been ready for it. Why not, and what made you ready when it was.",Lacey
43:27:00,"(sighs) The struggle to maintain your innocence,",Jim
43:33:00,maintain that wonder and that divine spark in a world that's seemingly cruel and out of control.,Jim
43:40:00,"Also, the grief aspect of it, the how do you keep that",Jim
43:46:00,"together when you've been hit by a freight train? And you know, I have, and I know what that's like.",Jim
43:54:00,I don't believe that any actor can really do a part unless that part finds them.,Jim
44:01:00,"You don't find parts, they find you when you're ready to do them and when you're informed",Jim
44:06:00,"and you have those feelings. I want to do a show about death, something special.",omit
44:12:00,I don't think we want to do a show about passing on.,omit
44:12:00,"No, not passing on, death.",omit
44:18:00,I don't want to say my son is off cloud surfing or hula,omit
44:18:00,hooping with a halo.,omit
44:23:00,I want to say death.,omit
44:23:00,"Well, it's brave of you but I don't think you're ready to talk about this.",omit
44:23:00,I don't think I'm not ready like you think I'm not ready.,omit
44:31:00,I think we need to heal.,omit
44:31:00,Who's we?,omit
44:31:00,"I mean, what about you, taking on this role? What was it about this guy?",Lacey
44:39:00,"I love him. I've only taught four or five times, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.",Henry
44:47:00,It is written so well that I don't know what to do. (group chuckling),Henry
44:53:00,"And again, everything is, we are blessed with wonderful writers because if it's not on the page",Henry
45:01:00,it ain't on the stage. I love the people that I work with. They are an incredible ensemble that make me better.,Henry
45:11:00,And I just thoroughly love going to work every day.,Henry
45:11:00,(knocks on door) Cousineau?,Omit
45:17:00,"Hey, Private Pyle, how you doing?",omit
45:17:00,"Oh, let's not call me that.",omit
45:17:00,"The story, just an idea.",omit
45:25:00,There's an embellishment called the Dennehy Balloon. Actually it's a colostomy bag filled with blood,omit
45:30:00,"that Brian Dennehy used during Deathtrap. When he was shot, he would. (groans)",omit
45:36:00,To piggyback on what everyone has said and that you ape and act like you came up with it. (group laughing),Don
45:46:00,"That, you know, it's true. You are bringing yourself to these roles. We don't completely shut off and we're not there.",Don
45:55:00,"We're there and you're exercising and you're accessing different parts of your personality,",Don
46:00:00,"different parts of your pain, different parts of your joy and trying to find where you and this character meet.",Don
46:07:00,And sometimes you're reaching for things that are out there beyond you that you're trying to scaffold to,Don
46:12:00,"and other times you're like, that's a little too close. Can we not do that beat right now?",Don
46:18:00,"But if you're really honest, and I think all of us probably have a good relationship with the writers that we're working with that",Don
46:24:00,Absolutely.,?
46:24:00,"You're in a conversation. It's not like they just stick it all on the page and go,",Don
46:29:00,"say all of that, you know. You're always in a conversation, and when you're in that conversation",Don
46:34:00,"you're trying to get to the best iteration of what that thing is so you are bringing yourself to these moments, and that's when it sings.",Don
46:43:00,"I mean, my writers are perfectly happy for me to improv a scene and they go, ""That's good, that was better, move on.""",Don
46:49:00,"You know, best answer wins.",Don
46:49:00,Mm.,omit
46:49:00,I'm gonna call an ambulance.,omit
46:55:00,"What kinda car you drive, kid?",omit
46:55:00,"Oh, 'cause I drive a Honda and you drive a Porsche?",omit
46:55:00,"I don't drive shit, I get driven.",omit
47:01:00,Mm,omit
47:01:00,hmm.,omit
47:01:00,"In an Lamborghini limousine. AKA a Lambo limo, AKA a Limbo.",omit
47:07:00,So you get none of the speed of a Lamborghini and none of the comfort of the limousine?,omit
47:07:00,"Yeah, but it costs twice as much as both.",omit
47:13:00,"This guy is not a car guy, you're not a car guy.",omit
47:13:00,I don't like your fucking tone.,omit
47:13:00,"You don't know shit about cracks. Who are you, Pfaff, who are you?",omit
47:21:00,"What were the moments when it's too close and it's, I don't know?",Lacey
47:21:00,"Well, you know, it's funny.",Don
47:27:00,"In talking about the too closeness is not just, there's other people that it affects. So sometimes I don't talk about it",Don
47:33:00,"because it's very personal, but I have had more than one instance in jobs that I'm working on",Don
47:39:00,"where you're like, why is this storyline happening that's also happening in my life that these people didn't know anything about.",Don
47:45:00,"Oh, interesting.",Lacey
47:45:00,This is something that I'm getting to work through and getting to play,Don
47:51:00,with these other great collaborators around me that's really something that I'm dealing with in my personal life.,Don
47:56:00,"Yeah, there's a synchronicity.",Jim
47:56:00,Yeah.,Don
47:56:00,In everything.,Jim
47:56:00,"Yeah, it very often happens to me I've found in my work, and you're going,",Don
48:02:00,"what am I pulling toward me? You know, it's not just that things are out there for you to go get, a lot of times these things",Don
48:08:00,"are kind of coalescing around you and you're like, wow, did I pull that in so that I could work through this in some way, and it just feels like that a lot of time.",Don
48:15:00,So I always feel like there's a lot of me in whatever,Don
48:15:00,It what you're doing.,Lacey
48:15:00,Whatever I'm doing. (upbeat instrumental music),Don
48:25:00,"And Sacha, I have to ask you, what are the wildest circumstances under which you secured",Lacey
48:31:00,or perhaps didn't secure an interview for the show. In some cases you're undercover for a while,Lacey
48:37:00,as you're trying to get it. In some cases you're trying to pass through major security.,Lacey
48:42:00,"Yeah, to get in the room with the person is already a terrible ordeal. (group laughing)",Sacha
48:48:00,"So we managed to secure an interview with Ben Carson, but it was at a hotel in D.C.",Sacha
48:55:00,I'd been living undercover for three weeks in D.C. because I didn't wanna have any sightings of me.,Sacha
49:02:00,"Wow, wow.",Don
49:02:00,Because if somebody asked for a picture of me.,Sacha
49:02:00,"They're like, oh, it's him.",Don
49:02:00,"What does that look like, then?",Lacey
49:07:00,What does living undercover?,Lacey
49:07:00,It means that no one can see your face for three weeks.,Sacha
49:07:00,Peeing in jars and stuff like that.,Jim
49:07:00,"So masks, is that masks,",Lacey
49:13:00,"wigs, is it masks, wigs or it just staying inside?",Lacey
49:13:00,"I don't want to go into what I was wearing,",Sacha
49:19:00,"but it's mainly staying inside and you're never going through, you're trying to avoid being seen.",Sacha
49:19:00,Okay.,Lacey
49:24:00,Or you can't use your credit card or anything for as long as you're undercover,Lacey
49:29:00,because the first person we interviewed when we got into D.C. was Bernie Sanders.,Sacha
49:34:00,"They were concerned, his team actually are great, are great because they immediately called up the channel",Sacha
49:41:00,"and they said, ""What's going on?"" But the channel didn't know that we were making the show so they actually honestly said, well, you know.",Sacha
49:47:00,"It's fine, they then said, well how do we know this isn't a terrorist group that are trying to attack politicians",Sacha
49:55:00,and we might have a congressional hearing. So there was a game of cat and mouse. So I knew I had to kind of stay undercover.,Sacha
50:01:00,Then with Ben Carson we managed to get an interview,Sacha
50:06:00,"and that hotel that we picked, there was a problem because there was a conference",Sacha
50:12:00,of other politicians and there was Condoleezza Rice there and a bunch of other kinda high,Sacha
50:12:00,end politicians,Sacha
50:18:00,and the place was full of Secret Service. So me even getting to the room was a kind of huge problem,Sacha
50:26:00,cause there's Secret Service.,Sacha
50:26:00,Cause you had to be Sacha with your ID.,Sacha
50:26:00,"Well no. You don't have present your ID at a hotel, but yes,",Sacha
50:35:00,"he came with his own Secret Service, so I'm in the other room saying, and there were probably about 50, 60 Secret Service there.",Sacha
50:42:00,"He comes with two Secret Service, but you know, we'd made a mistake. We'd gone to the worst hotel ever to interview him",Sacha
50:49:00,where all these other Secret Service are around to make sure nothing happens.,Sacha
50:49:00,"Right, right.",Don
50:49:00,"And by the way, the Secret Service there,",Sacha
50:57:00,"it sounds like complete paranoia, but some of them disguise themselves as staff.",Sacha
51:02:00,And I'm obviously disguised.,Sacha
51:02:00,Wow.,Jim
51:02:00,"Oh my God, balls.",Ted
51:02:00,So I'm in the other room,Sacha
51:09:00,"and I realize he's got his own Secret Service and I get on the phone to my lawyer and I go, what happens if they ask to see ID?",Sacha
51:15:00,Yeah?,Lacey
51:15:00,Yeah.,Don
51:15:00,Like if they go and see my ID and they find out it's me and blast it you know.,Sacha
51:15:00,And blast it.,Don
51:15:00,"I said, ""Listen, I've got fake ID.",Sacha
51:21:00,"""Can I present my fake ID?"" And they go, ""No."" At the end of the phone he goes, ""No, you're gonna go to jail.""",Sacha
51:21:00,"Yeah, exactly.",Don
51:21:00,"I go, ""What happens if the fake ID",Sacha
51:27:00,"""falls on the floor and the Secret Service pick it up?""",Sacha
51:27:00,"You're not actually presenting it, okay.",Lacey
51:33:00,"Yes, and he goes, ""All right, there may be a way ""out of it, but you might get arrested.""",Sacha
51:38:00,So you're going into a scene knowing that you're trying to work out the percentage,Sacha
51:43:00,of something bad happening. And then we booked another room,Sacha
51:48:00,"which was in case we got busted by the Secret Service that I would go to, so his team, I made one slip up.",Sacha
51:56:00,"This is the kind of, this is the problem of the stuff that I do which is that you make one mistake and the scene is dead.",Sacha
52:04:00,Right.,Don
52:04:00,Mm,Jim
52:04:00,hmm.,Jim
52:04:00,"So it was tragic for me because he was so high up,",Sacha
52:09:00,"but Ben Carson literally, his foot was stepping on set and the White House Press Secretary pulled the interview",Sacha
52:18:00,"cause I was playing this Finnish unboxing character and I had these kids toys and he said,",Sacha
52:24:00,"""Why have you got all those kids toys?"" I was like, ""You know, we're going to do some unboxing."" And he said, ""Unboxing, why?""",Sacha
52:30:00,"And he suddenly realizes that a member of the cabinet is coming in to unbox and he had great instincts, this guy,",Sacha
52:37:00,and pulled it so the Secret Service pulled Ben Carson but then the rest of the Secret Service in the building,Sacha
52:44:00,are alerted to the fact that something's happening. And obviously they have to treat it as a serious thing.,Sacha
52:50:00,So I then go to the second room that is booked under a different name.,Sacha
52:50:00,Oh my God.,Don
52:56:00,But then we have a ex,Sacha
52:56:00,"Secret Service bodyguard and he's like, ""They're listening in."" I actually thought that the bodyguard was paranoid.",Sacha
53:04:00,But it turned out that he was right. And then we're playing cat and mouse with the Secret Service.,Sacha
53:04:00,They're trying to find you and you're jumping around.,Don
53:04:00,"Yes, they don't know",Sacha
53:11:00,who I am because they have to treat it as a security threat.,Sacha
53:11:00,"Right, oh my God.",Don
53:11:00,And then we're trying to work out how do we get,Sacha
53:17:00,"(mimics silenced gun shooting) Oh, it's the comedian dude. I like that guy. (group laughing)",Don
53:17:00,And then also you're trying to keep it undercover,Sacha
53:24:00,"off even this, then it's, how do I get me out of, we know that Secret Service in the building",Sacha
53:29:00,are looking for this guy.,Sacha
53:29:00,Right.,Don
53:29:00,"This Finnish guy. They don't know what's happened,",Sacha
53:34:00,but somebody's tried to do something.,SAcha
53:34:00,So how do you get out?,Lacey
53:34:00,To a cabinet minister. And then we're working out how to get out of the hotel.,Sacha
53:40:00,"And you know, we've got a back route. We always have escape routes, but then we find out",Sacha
53:46:00,Now you're gonna get the interview.,Jim
53:46:00,And we find out they're at the escape route.,Sacha
53:46:00,What are the escape route?,Jim
53:46:00,They're at the escape route,Sacha
53:51:00,"so we ended up going through the front door, the main entrance, and the guy with me, he said,",Sacha
53:56:00,"""If anyone comes towards you, I'm going to stop them."" I go, ""What does that mean?"" And he goes, ""I'm gonna stop 'em."" I go, ""Is that legal?""",Sacha
54:02:00,"He goes, ""yes,"" and he goes, ""you just have to get from here ""from the elevator to that car.""",Sacha
54:07:00,"And so a lot of, 80% of what I do is this getting in",Sacha
54:12:00,and getting out.,Sacha
54:12:00,Wow.,Henry
54:12:00,Of situations.,Sacha
54:12:00,Do you get nervous.,Lacey
54:12:00,I'm absolutely terrified.,Sacha
54:12:00,And yet you go back for more,Lacey
54:20:00,and more and more.,Lacey
54:20:00,The junkie.,Don
54:20:00,"I don't know, yeah. I don't know what it is, it becomes addictive. I mean, we did this scene where I pitch building",Sacha
54:29:00,a mega,Sacha
54:29:00,"mosque in this town and we knew there'd be upset, but you have the other stuff",Sacha
54:29:00,"Oh, they were really upset.",Don
54:38:00,"They were really upset, but then you're in this situation where you say, okay, we wanna make sure",Sacha
54:43:00,that even when they get upset we know they're probably gonna get upset because they probably hate the idea of Muslims,Sacha
54:48:00,"coming into their town, we wanna make sure that nobody's going to pull a gun. And so we had a security guard there and he said,",Sacha
54:56:00,"""Listen, you know, the great thing is ""you're all right,"" because I had a clipboard, he goes,",Sacha
55:02:00,"""I've made you a bulletproof clipboard."" And I go, ""What do you mean?""",Sacha
55:02:00,You're Wonder Woman.,Don
55:02:00,"Because if someone pulls a gun, you know,",Sacha
55:07:00,"someone snuck in a gun and they're gonna try and shoot you pull out, use the clipboard and just cover yourself with it.",Sacha
55:13:00,"Yeah, just deflect the bullet.",Don
55:13:00,"I go, ""It's this big."" I go, ""What do I put it over, like the heart or the head?""",Sacha
55:20:00,"Center of mass, they usually go for center of mass.",Don
55:20:00,"Groin, groin.",Jim
55:20:00,"Yeah, so I was like, he goes, ""I don't know, because that's the size clipboard",Sacha
55:25:00,"Äúthat I was told,"" so again, it's not really",Sacha
55:25:00,An actor's choice.,Ted
55:25:00,An actor's choice.,Don
55:25:00,So we had like a scene like that,Sacha
55:31:00,"and it got fairly aggressive at the end and somebody, he said, you know, it got nearly violent",Sacha
55:39:00,"because I accused somebody of being a Muslim. I said, ""Excuse me sir, are you a Muslim?"" And he'd go, ""You say that again, I'm gonna come up.""",Sacha
55:39:00,"Yeah, he said he was gonna kill you, yeah.",Don
55:45:00,"Yeah, yeah.",Sacha
55:45:00,That's on camera.,Don
55:45:00,"And then, so, you know, I think, you seem like you're a Muslim, and they got very offended,",Sacha
55:52:00,and it became confrontational actually.,Sacha
55:52:00,"And what's going through your head? I'm gonna risk this, I got my clipboard?",Lacey
55:57:00,"I go deep into character at that point. If it feels like it's going to get violent then you can't, the worst thing you can do is crack",Sacha
56:05:00,"and then realize that you're playing a character. You don't go, hey, oh, I just wanna mock you and expose your racism.",Sacha
56:05:00,Right.,Don
56:12:00,"Then you're really in trouble and then what I'm doing in my head, and again, I'm English,",Sacha
56:19:00,"not really fully aware of what's going on, but I'm trying to edit the scene so I'm trying to, I know the beginning setup to the joke,",Sacha
56:26:00,"the joke, the following joke, and then I need the out.",Sacha
56:26:00,"How do you get out, yeah.",Don
56:26:00,And then I need the out for that.,Sacha
56:26:00,The shot fired,Ted
56:33:00,is probably your out. (group laughing),Ted
56:33:00,I wanna get out.,?
56:33:00,Clipboard!,Jim
56:38:00,It has the end on the end.,Jim
56:38:00,I wanna get an out before,Sacha
56:38:00,That's astounding.,Ted
56:38:00,Before you're killed.,Henry
56:38:00,I have fucked up so many scenes,Timothy
56:44:00,"where the only threat was like rolling into lunch. Like, that's the only shit that was on my mind.",Timothy
56:51:00,"My biggest problem is overhead lighting. I'm 57, man, it scares the hell out of me.",Jim
56:56:00,"It's interesting, in a scene like that, so we then go, okay, let's do the scene again. And we know that it's gotten the guy at the end he goes,",Sacha
57:03:00,"you know, now I know why you took your gun so fast 'cause we took their guns off them, weapons off them before they got on a bus",Sacha
57:09:00,"that took 'em to the river. Then we knew that the next group that were coming into the room, 'cause we wanted to do the scene again.",Sacha
57:16:00,"Do another take, we have to get another. They would have their cars outside the hole",Sacha
57:21:00,"and we were concerned that they would go out, get upset, get their guns, and bring them in.",Sacha
57:21:00,Sure.,Lacey
57:21:00,And so at that point,Sacha
57:29:00,"you've gotta act as the producer. And so I had a meeting with everyone. I just said, listen, we're now aware",Sacha
57:34:00,of how angry people are getting. I want you to opt in to the next scene.,Sacha
57:40:00,"In other words, I'm assuming everyone's going home unless you say now, I'm gonna stay",Sacha
57:47:00,because we're aware that we can't guarantee that we're not gonna be stuck in this hole,Sacha
57:53:00,"and everyone with their guns outside and not letting us out, you know? So we had, it was a kind of odd",Sacha
58:00:00,"Do people, I mean, how many stay, how many go?",Lacey
58:00:00,In the end I forced quite a lot of people to go home.,Sacha
58:05:00,You did?,Lacey
58:05:00,"Yes. 'Cause everyone said, ""We're staying,"" and I said, ""No, actually you guys are going."" You know, and obviously you have an escape wherever,",Sacha
58:11:00,but at the end of the day we're in a situation where violence is being threatened. We know that most people had their own weapons,Sacha
58:19:00,and we knew that it was a possibility that we might be on lockdown. We might have to stay in the building.,Sacha
58:25:00,"How do you deal with people, do people have to sign off?",Ted
58:25:00,"That I can't get into, but.",Sacha
58:25:00,Okay.,Ted
58:25:00,That scares you?,Jim
58:25:00,"C'mon, c'mon, do the FBI.",Don
58:33:00,Cause your faces as he's telling these stories is enough.,Lacey
58:33:00,"No, it's wonderful, but it is, comedy is dangerous.",Jim
58:41:00,It is dangerous.,Jim
58:41:00,Comedy is dangerous.,Henry
58:41:00,"It truly is, I mean, there were many nights at The Comedy Store where I ended up on someone's table",Jim
58:47:00,"with a broken beer bottle, you know. I mean, it got crazy, insane.",Jim
58:47:00,I'm sure.,Sacha
58:53:00,"Oh, absolutely.",Jim
58:53:00,"Yeah, I'm sure, listen, you have",Sacha
58:53:00,Or drove the entire audience out because I stayed up too long when they hated me,Jim
59:00:00,"I would go at them, it was not, okay, you don't like what I'm doing.",Jim
59:00:00,"And you used to stay up there for hours, didn't you?",Sacha
59:00:00,There was one,Jim
59:08:00,"particular night, in fact, where I stayed up for two hours because the audience hated me so I just",Jim
59:14:00,Punish.,?
59:14:00,Made it an exercise in self,Jim
59:14:00,punishment and punishment for them.,Jim
59:14:00,And it's kinda finesse.,Sacha
59:14:00,"But what drives that, why?",Lacey
59:20:00,"I just, anti",Jim
59:20:00,"authority, you know, I'm that way. And I'd rather get hit than back down.",Jim
59:28:00,"Wow, I'd drop to the floor. (group laughing)",Henry
59:28:00,I'm with you.,Lacey
59:28:00,"So yeah, one night",Jim
59:34:00,"I stayed up so long that chairs were flying through the air, it was like New Year's Eve.",Jim
59:40:00,There was swizzle sticks and whatever and glass and things like that and then I said,Jim
59:40:00,"Where was this, in LA?",Ted
59:40:00,The Comedy Store.,Jim
59:46:00,It was a Saturday night in the main room. 250 people paying top dollar and whatever and it became a war.,Jim
59:46:00,Were you Jim Carrey yet,Ted
59:55:00,or was this en route?,TEd
59:55:00,I was en route.,Jim
59:55:00,"Did you feel like you ultimately, did you win the war?",Lacey
1:00:00,"[Sacha] If you're Jim Carrey, sit down on this chair.",Sacha
1:00:00,"Well, I don't know if I",Jim
1:00:00,Yeah.,Sacha
1:00:00,"Well, I'll tell you how the war ended. So I finally got offstage to huge applause",Jim
1:00:07,"just because I mentioned that I was going to leave the stage. (group laughing) And they were just like. (growls) Like that, and I left the stage.",Jim
1:00:15,"Then I crawled through the audience on hands and knees, popped up behind the piano during the host's part",Jim
1:00:22,"and started banging on the keys and singing, I hate you all, you gave me cancer.",Jim
1:00:28,And it was an entire improvised song,Jim
1:00:28,And they loved that.,Sacha
1:00:28,"No, they got up. One at a time the tables got up and",Jim
1:00:34,Did you write it on the spot?,Henry
1:00:34,"Yeah, it was just blaming them for the cancer cells that are being formed, and so I, you know, I did that",Jim
1:00:44,"until the entire audience left, literally the entire audience except for five people",Jim
1:00:50,who stood around the piano and when I was done in a sweat,Jim
1:00:55,"they said, ""This is the greatest thing ""we've ever seen in our lives.""",Jim
1:00:55,But that's performance art.,Sacha
1:00:55,"Yeah, yeah. Now it turns into comedy.",Don
1:00:55,And then I got in the car,Jim
1:01:01,and I cried all the way home.,Jim
1:01:01,You did?,Lacey
1:01:01,Yeah.,Jim
1:01:01,Wow.,Don
1:01:01,Because I don't wanna make people unhappy.,Jim
1:01:07,"I'm here to make people happy, but I do have",Jim
1:01:07,So you lost.,Lacey
1:01:07,A rebellious nature. So sometimes that gets out of hand.,Jim
1:01:14,What a conundrum.,Henry
1:01:14,"This is a bit of a left turn, but I wanna ask, why do you guys do comedy?",Lacey
1:01:14,You have a thing in you,Henry
1:01:24,where it literally pushes you to say the joke either at a party or on the sound stage.,Henry
1:01:31,"You literally have timing, you cannot teach it. You can't read about it in a book.",Henry
1:01:37,"It is in you or it isn't, and that's just the truth. It is more difficult than I think than doing",Henry
1:01:45,"just straight drama, and we get less respect",Henry
1:01:52,because it looks so easy.,Henry
1:01:52,And much less respect after today.,Sacha
1:01:57,Hush.,Lacey
1:01:57,"No, but it's like being a surfer, it's like being a surfer. You're in the water and there's a wave that's coming",Jim
1:02:03,"and it's an opportunity to be funny. And if you have that instinct you're sitting there going,",Jim
1:02:08,"am I gonna ride this wave? It's a bit dangerous, but am I gonna ride it?",Jim
1:02:08,I don't know that you make the decision.,Henry
1:02:15,"The image is exactly right, here comes the wave. And I don't think, well, for me anyway,",Henry
1:02:20,I don't think sometimes I have the choice. I think that wave is coming and (mimics wind whistling),Henry
1:02:26,"I'm on that board come hell or high water, no pun intended.",Henry
1:02:26,"Well, maybe I'm kidding myself, but I always feel like, especially if you're saying something",Jim
1:02:31,"that's slightly dangerous, there's that cliffs of Acapulco moment.",Jim
1:02:31,Right.,Henry
1:02:36,"Where the tide has come in, you either dive or you don't.",Jim
1:02:36,Right.,Henry
1:02:36,And if you don't dive,Jim
1:02:42,it's gone forever.,Jim
1:02:42,Right.,Henry
1:02:42,"But you know, most of the time you gotta go.",Jim
1:02:42,You gotta go.,Henry
1:02:42,Even if you belly flop.,Jim
1:02:49,"And I also think it's something, that to piggyback on something that Sacha said, it breaks down walls and it's immediately, it hits people,",Don
1:02:57,"and when you know when people feel like something's funny and even if they don't wanna laugh you're like, no, that one got you.",Don
1:02:57,Yeah.,?
1:02:57,And once you're in there then you can turn it,Don
1:03:04,and you can make poignant moments and you can make them feel things deeply because they're unguarded.,Don
1:03:10,They've let down their defenses and you're in there and you can move around in there.,Henry
1:03:15,And it's easy to do,Don
1:03:15,"But you've excelled in both spheres, I mean it's...",Sacha
1:03:15,"I guess, I mean it's just, I never saw the separation",Don
1:03:23,"between it when I was coming up, which is where we all probably, you're still that kid, eight, nine, 10,",Don
1:03:29,"whatever years old that was like, oh, this is cool. I can play this character and people laugh and then people are sad.",Don
1:03:35,"It's still kind of that, although in 55 years it's still the same thing except it's more disarming",Don
1:03:42,"for me, I feel, when you come at it from a comedy standpoint because people",Don
1:03:42,"I don't know, Hotel Rwanda",Sacha
1:03:47,I remember just that being,Sacha
1:03:47,Unbelievable.,?
1:03:47,"So impactful, you know, however much we can do in comedy,",Sacha
1:03:53,"I mean, that really changes your mindset about it.",Sacha
1:03:53,"Yeah, and even in that, I mean, even in that",Don
1:03:59,"at the beginning we really, he was disarming. The character was telling jokes and he was ebullient",Don
1:04:06,"and messing around and cracking jokes. You get in with him because you're like, oh, I like this person.",Don
1:04:11,"This person makes me feel comfortable, my guard is down. And once your guard is down now you can take people everywhere.",Don
1:04:18,And that's something that comedy's easy to do.,Don
1:04:18,I think comedy is like not always the end game.,Jim
1:04:24,People like Bill Maher and,Jim
1:04:24,It's about the art.,Sacha
1:04:24,And Colbert and they're attacking this subject,Jim
1:04:29,"in a comedic way, but I do believe that when it comes down to it and the wolf is at the door",Jim
1:04:35,"there ain't nothing funny about that. And if you give them a joke about it, that's fine.",Jim
1:04:42,"It heals in that moment, but it also is an out",Jim
1:04:48,"for the audience and for the enemy. And the enemy goes, is this a joke?",Jim
1:04:53,"I want people to know how serious I am about the threat that faces us, you know?",Jim
1:04:59,"And if I make it a joke, I can, that's part of it, but if I make it a joke it's not as serious",Jim
1:05:06,"Okay, well I watched Stephen Colbert and Seth at the end of the night because it",Henry
1:05:14,is like an antidote for the day.,Henry
1:05:14,"Yes, mm",Jim
1:05:14,hmm.,Jim
1:05:14,"And let me just say underneath those jokes, they are serious.",Henry
1:05:21,"Yeah, for sure.",Jim
1:05:21,"Well, there's no joke unless you're on the nerve of the thing anyway. You know, if it's just frivolous, and that's something we talk about on the show,",Don
1:05:26,it has to really be about something that's grounded and that's impactful or the joke has no power.,Don
1:05:26,"So there you go, you are completely correct.",Henry
1:05:34,"When it is frivolous, you are so right, then you're missing the whole opportunity, but boy,",Henry
1:05:41,when you walk that edge.,Henry
1:05:41,That's right on the nerve.,Don
1:05:41,Wow.,Henry
1:05:41,Yeah.,Don
1:05:41,"It is, but I think there's a time to say things straight",Jim
1:05:46,so they know what you mean.,Jim
1:05:46,"I just feel like, I don't know that I had much of a choice in the matter. Like, I have always been somebody",Timothy
1:05:53,"I think from when I was a kid, was able to see the serious things, I just have only ever",Timothy
1:05:59,"been able to deal with them through this lens and this lens of like, oh, well I need to make myself comfortable in this by coming at it sideways.",Timothy
1:06:07,"And there is, I don't know if you guys did, I had a conversation with a friend of mine about this recently that sometimes when stuff comes up",Timothy
1:06:14,"with your family, I don't know if you're a bomb thrower, sometimes throwing bombs, sometimes they explode,",Timothy
1:06:20,"but it just, I don't know when it happened but just ever since I was a kid in whatever situation it was it was like, all right,",Timothy
1:06:27,"well, I'm just gonna put this in here and see how that goes. Like, it is fun.",Timothy
1:06:27,Absolutely.,Jim
1:06:27,And I do feel like you can,Timothy
1:06:27,But taking that risk,Henry
1:06:32,is great.,Henry
1:06:32,"There is a risk there, but the reward sometimes is, like, this is an impenetrable person and you got in with that.",Timothy
1:06:39,Yeah.,Henry
1:06:39,Right.,Jim
1:06:39,"That is a really amazing thing, and whether or not you can get to it a different way, certainly possible,",Timothy
1:06:46,but my way into it has always been through that.,Timothy
1:06:46,Complete this sentence. I knew I made it in Hollywood when.,Lacey
1:06:53,I wasn't dead yet. (Lacey laughs),Don
1:06:53,"Interesting, when you weren't dead yet?",Ted
1:07:00,"Kinda, I mean, really people ask that question. I really feel like they say, well your career's, I'm like, well, let me look back when I'm done and go,",Don
1:07:08,"okay, I did that, I felt good about that because",Don
1:07:08,Careers are something you look back at.,Ted
1:07:08,"Yeah, I mean, I feel like all of us,",Don
1:07:17,"there's a bit of impostor syndrome I think that comes up for many of us and you're like, at some point they're just gonna go, yeah,",Don
1:07:23,"we've had that flavor, thank you, next guy.",Don
1:07:23,"I feel like everybody that I've met, like outwardly you look at them and you think,",Timothy
1:07:30,"oh, well that person's fine, like they're perfect. They're sailing, like they're never gonna have to hustle",Timothy
1:07:36,and then you meet 'em and they still hustle.,Timothy
1:07:36,You bet.,Henry
1:07:36,"And they're still after it and it doesn't matter, and so that feeling of like,",Timothy
1:07:41,"I've made it in Hollywood, I don't know that that actually exists.",Timothy
1:07:41,Exactly.,Don
1:07:41,"Okay, but you do have your sort of first dose of success and feeling like, oh, I can make career of this.",Lacey
1:07:49,But it's fleeting.,Don
1:07:49,"I did get to meet Steve Buscemi at a party one time, and I will fucking tell you that was amazing.",Timothy
1:07:54,"That was your moment, okay.",Lacey
1:07:54,That was some great shit right there.,Timothy
1:07:54,I love it.,Lacey
1:07:54,I knew that people were watching Happy Days,Henry
1:08:01,"when I went from my first personal appearance. I got off the plane at 11:30 and there were 3,000 people",Henry
1:08:08,"in '50s clothes and I thought it was a party. And the stewardess said, ""No, I think that's for you.""",Henry
1:08:14,"And I went, ""Oh, people are watching.",Henry
1:08:14,"Yeah, wow.",Lacey
1:08:14,"Okay, so the rest of us have not made it, basically.",Ted
1:08:14,"Yeah, apparently not.",Lacey
1:08:21,We just discovered.,Ted
1:08:21,"A lot of times it's the people you meet, the people you get to hang with.",Jim
1:08:27,"You know, I grew up with Dick Van Dyke, and I was a complete lunatic for Dick Van Dyke.",Jim
1:08:32,"Me, too.",Ted
1:08:32,And I've been able to meet Dick Van Dyke and he wants to hang out,Jim
1:08:38,and them saying that they love what you do is really meaningful.,Jim
1:08:38,Yeah.,Henry
1:08:43,I just drew him a cartoon that I sent to him of RCA Television from 1969 and a black and white version,Jim
1:08:54,of the opening credits for the Dick Van Dyke Show where he trips over the ottoman.,Jim
1:08:59,What a great show.,Ted
1:08:59,"And I'm in front, and I did a cartoon of myself tripping over the ottoman in front of the television, and those",Jim
1:09:06,"are the types of things that keep happening to me. I'm constantly being reminded, oh, I made it.",Jim
1:09:12,"Oh my gosh, that's wonderful. And the first time I think In Living Color was huge,",Jim
1:09:19,"was a huge thing for me and it was like they planted me, you know, my seedling in the garden",Jim
1:09:24,and I had a chance to bloom on that show. So I got a taste of it there. And that time in Chicago when Siskel and Ebert,Jim
1:09:33,"hated my movie and then Friday happened and it was a giant hit, and the hotel staff",Jim
1:09:41,where I was staying put a dog bowl in my room with candies in it.,Jim
1:09:41,Aw.,Henry
1:09:46,(knocks table) Did it. Never gonna be the same.,Jim
1:09:46,I love that.,Lacey
1:09:46,"I think it's a balancing act for me, too.",Ted
1:09:54,"Cause careers, if you celebrate your career in the moment then it feels like you're slowing down.",Ted
1:10:02,"So you're always looking for what's next or what can I do better? Or one of these days, literally, I'm gonna be good.",Ted
1:10:08,"You know, that kind of thinking, you know, as opposed to celebrating, but you also",Ted
1:10:13,"don't wanna be a shmo and not go, thank you, thank you.",Ted
1:10:13,You bet.,Henry
1:10:13,Yeah.,Lacey
1:10:13,"[Ted] Thank you, but it is a delicate balance.",Ted
1:10:18,You bet.,Henry
1:10:18,At a certain point you have to pick up the crown and wear it well.,Jim
1:10:18,Absolutely.,Lacey
1:10:18,You know that,Jim
1:10:24,"whatever that crown is that wherever your place of fame is is like, there's two choices.",Jim
1:10:30,"You reject it, you push it away, you don't think you deserve it or you go, you know what,",Jim
1:10:35,I'm gonna wear this as well as I can.,Jim
1:10:35,"And it's usually in the eye of the beholder. Fame is not, you know, you don't sit around going fame.",Ted
1:10:41,Someone comes up and says you're famous and you are gracious and you meet them,Ted
1:10:47,at whatever level they're talking about and that's,Ted
1:10:47,Was there a pinch me moment for you?,Ted
1:10:47,"No, but I'm gonna have one, I swear.",Ted
1:10:54,It's coming?,Lacey
1:10:54,By the time I'm through acting.,Ted
1:10:54,It's coming.,Henry
1:10:54,It's coming for you.,Lacey
1:10:54,Can I go back and celebrate,Ted
1:10:59,Dick Van Dyke for a second?,Ted
1:10:59,Yes.,Jim
1:10:59,Because I grew up with no television in the country.,Ted
1:10:59,I'm still doing his stuff.,Jim
1:11:05,"By the way, Sonic is coming out and I've got moves in there that I can't wait for him to see.",Jim
1:11:11,"That's one. (group laughing) So the first thing, I got a black and white TV. Stanford University freshman, and it was my first TV",Ted
1:11:19,"literally ever, I tapped into a teacher's cable, crawled out of the thing, turned it on",Ted
1:11:25,"and it was 11 o'clock in the morning and it was a rerun of Dick Van Dyke, and that was my first and I fell madly in love",Ted
1:11:32,with Dick Van Dyke and then years later on Becker he played my father and it was just this full circle.,Ted
1:11:38,Wow.,Henry
1:11:38,And thing of just awe.,Ted
1:11:38,Yeah.,Jim
1:11:38,"He was my hero, my physical.",Ted
1:11:38,"Yeah, he's the man.",Don
1:11:44,There was one time where Paul McCartney in like a Twitter question and answer session somebody asked him what were his two favorite shows,Timothy
1:11:51,"and one I think was just a UK reality show, and then he mentioned our show in this, like, those are my two favorite shows.",Timothy
1:11:57,And I do think there was a moment of quiet in the room. It was interesting to know in that moment,Timothy
1:12:02,that you were a part of something that a Beatle noticed.,Timothy
1:12:02,Yeah. (group laughing),Ted
1:12:02,"Like, that seemed like a gigantic thing.",Timothy
1:12:08,"You didn't even get to take the rest of the day off, but there was a thing, like I grew up, I lived my entire life and it came to this moment",Timothy
1:12:15,and a Beatle knew something that I did and that seems in itself insurmountable.,Timothy
1:12:20,"Like, that was a moment that was cool.",Timothy
1:12:20,John Cleese for me.,Ted
1:12:20,I love that.,Sacha
1:12:20,[Ted] When he knew Cheers and knew who we were.,Ted
1:12:27,"Oh, really.",Sacha
1:12:27,Amazing.,Jim
1:12:27,What's the moment for you?,Lacey
1:12:27,All those guys.,Jim
1:12:27,"There were a lot of moments. I mean, connected with this table,",Sacha
1:12:33,I used to do a character called Ali G. I was shooting in LA and then I met Jimmy Miller,Sacha
1:12:38,"who was Jim's manager and he said, ""Jim loves your stuff. ""He wants you to come over to his house.""",Sacha
1:12:45,At that time in England there was an assumption that no one would ever get to Hollywood.,Sacha
1:12:51,"You know, it had been 30 years since Sellers or 25 years since Python, there was just an assumption",Sacha
1:12:58,that English comedy will never travel across the pond. And I remember the next night I turned up at Jim's house.,Sacha
1:13:06,"I was invited, I wasn't just",Sacha
1:13:06,(group laughing) I broke in and I,Sacha
1:13:06,I took something.,Don
1:13:12,"And he opened the door. And you know, it was the biggest movie star in the world and obviously brilliantly talented.",Sacha
1:13:18,"And he knew what I was doing. And my other hero was there, Gary Shandling, who unfortunately passed away.",Sacha
1:13:25,I couldn't believe that I was there. And I was completely terrified 'cause I remembered Jim and Gary started making jokes.,Sacha
1:13:32,"And at one point he made a joke, you won't remember any of this, he did a really funny joke, he went like this.",Sacha
1:13:37,"And I thought, oh my God, at some point they're gonna expect me to make it",Sacha
1:13:37,"Get on the board, get on the board.",Don
1:13:37,Get on the board.,Don
1:13:37,He'd be in trouble.,Sacha
1:13:45,"But that was an amazing moment for this guy grown up in a suburb of London who never thought,",Sacha
1:13:52,"you know, I thought I was gonna be a lawyer or something like that. I never thought I could actually get a career",Sacha
1:13:57,"out of being funny, you know?",Sacha
1:13:57,Yeah.,Lacey
1:13:57,"I had two choices with you, admiration or jealousy",Jim
1:14:04,and I chose admiration.,Jim
1:14:04,"Oh, that's very kind.",Sacha
1:14:04,But I assume that is a navigation you make.,Lacey
1:14:04,"Yes, it is.",Jim
1:14:04,"And those are two, yeah.",Lacey
1:14:10,"When a new voice comes along and you've been the voice and you go, ooh, there's a part of you that goes, wow.",Jim
1:14:17,"You know, have you lost your place or something like that.",Jim
1:14:17,Yeah?,Lacey
1:14:17,"Yeah, for sure.",Don
1:14:17,"But it wasn't that. I've always tried to make the choice of like,",Jim
1:14:24,what's this person doing?,Jim
1:14:24,"Oh, you were very gracious that night, yeah.",Sacha
1:14:24,That is making me feel uncomfortable and laugh my ass off.,Jim
1:14:33,"And it's admiration, and that's the only way to go you know.",Jim
1:14:38,"Two things, this is I guess knowing that you're, whatever you wanna call it.",Ted
1:14:38,Made it.,Lacey
1:14:44,"That you've made it is who you get to hang with, who you get to meet, you know, who are playing at relatively the same level",Ted
1:14:51,is really exciting. Do you remember the People Magazine who's hot and who's not?,Ted
1:14:51,"Oh, for sure.",Don
1:14:51,"I never was who's hot,",Ted
1:14:58,and I was always on who's not. (group laughing),Ted
1:14:58,I kept thinking,Ted
1:14:58,"Not, not.",Don
1:15:04,Didn't I have,Ted
1:15:04,You got robbed!,Jim
1:15:04,Didn't I have to be hot at one point to be not hot?,Ted
1:15:04,"(laughs) I never got to be hot,",Don
1:15:10,"I'm just not, not, not, not.",Don
1:15:10,You're really blowing apart the logic of this People Magazine.,Timothy
1:15:16,Thank you guys so much.,Lacey
1:15:16,"Oh, thank you.",?
1:15:16,Thank you.,Sacha
1:15:16,For being a part of this conversation. (upbeat instrumental music),Lacey
